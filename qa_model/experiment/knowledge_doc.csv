doc_title,heading3,Report to the membersThe Board submits its report together with the audited consolidated financial statements of KPMG LLP and its subsidiary undertakings (the group) for the year ended 30 September 2021 ,40
doc_title,heading4,Legal structureKPMG LLP is the UK member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International. Each member firm is a separate and independent legal entity and describes itself as such,44
doc_title,heading5,All member firms are committed to following common standards in the provision of services for clients and to maintaining the highest levels of independence and integrity,26
doc_title,heading6,KPMG LLP is incorporated in the UK as a limited liability partnership under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 and is referred to in these financial statements as ‘the partnership’,38
doc_title,heading7,"The partnership’s registered office is 15 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5GL",22
doc_title,heading8,"Principal activitiesThe principal activities of the group are the provision of professional services, notably audit, tax and legal, deal advisory and consulting. The group operates primarily through the partnership and its subsidiary undertakings, predominantly in the UK but also has operations in other countries as client contracts require (see note 26)",61
doc_title,heading9,"GovernanceDuring the year ended 30 September 2021, the governance structure of the partnership comprised: —The Board: the main governance body of the group, responsible for overseeing the stewardship, accountability and leadership of the group, providing clear-sighted counsel on the strategic direction of the group and alignment to its vision, values and purpose",65
doc_title,heading10, —The Executive Committee: responsible for driving the board-approved strategy for the group and leading on issues that cut across the group,25
doc_title,heading11,"Both the Board and Executive Committee are supported by various sub-committees; full details of the governance structures, including changes in year, as well as the composition and responsibilities of the Board, Executive Committee and sub-committees can be found on the group’s website and in the group’s separately published Transparency Report",66
doc_title,heading12,"Designated membersThe designated members (as defined in the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000) of the partnership during the year were:Jon Holt (appointed 21 July 2021)Jeremy BartonTim JonesBill Michael (resigned 28 February 2021)Members’ capitalThe group is financed through a combination of members’ capital, undistributed profits and borrowing facilities",72
doc_title,heading13,"Members’ capital is provided by each member on becoming a partner and is only repayable on retirement or resignation so generally remains stable from year to year. However, during the year, partners voted in favour of allocating £201 million of reserves to members’ capital, for repayment only after retirement, thereby retaining funds in the business for future investment. As a result, members’ capital increased to £258 million at 30 September 2021 (2020: £87 million)",95
doc_title,heading14,"Members’ profit shares and drawingsDuring the year, members receive monthly drawings and, from time to time, additional profit share distributions. The level and timing of the additional distributions are decided by the Executive Committee and approved by the Board, taking into account the group’s cash requirements for operating and investing activities",62
doc_title,heading15,"The remuneration model is designed to drive and reward behaviours consistent with our strategy and values, reflect an individual’s medium-term value as well as current year performance against their goals. It also promotes clarity and transparency amongst members regarding their own remuneration and that of other members. A member’s remuneration generally comprises two elements as described below based on target unit pay. The allocation of target units is communicated to members in November each year and is determined in relation to an individual’s medium-term value to the group",111
doc_title,heading16,"Each member’s unit allocation is determined with quality as the primary factor and with other factors such as past performance, market value of skill set, individual capability, leadership qualities and overall contribution to the group taken into account",44
doc_title,heading17,The profit allocated to members is distributed as follows:Base Unit Pay – each member will receive 75% of their target units;Bonus Unit Pay – each member will receive a multiplier of their remaining 25% bonus units based on their relative in-year performance against their performance metrics,54
doc_title,heading18,"These elements account for the majority of the total profit allocated to members. The remainder was allocated to those members who retired in the year, and who received an additional profit share in line with the KPMG LLP partnership agreement. A deduction is made from the total pay for any members if their behaviour, quality or performance has fallen below the levels expected by the Executive Committee and Board, as indicated by adverse Quality and Risk metrics",84

doc_title,heading20,"Financial performance during the yearRevenue grew by 6% year on year, to £2,433 million (2020: £2,303 million); on a like for like basis, excluding revenue of the restructuring and pensions businesses, net sales increased by 12% to £2,039 million (2020: £1,826 million)",69
doc_title,heading21,"All four of our capabilities delivered strong growth, with growth in net sales of 5% in Audit, 8% in Tax & Legal, 13% in Consulting and 31% in Deal Advisory, the latter benefitting from an increase in M&A activity and other discretionary spend projects",56
doc_title,heading22,"We continued to focus on operating in a lean and agile way as we adapted to remote and hybrid working. This focus resulted in a 29% growth in capability contribution, with growth across all four capabilities, and a 48% growth in profit for the financial year, excluding the profit on disposal of businesses in each year",62
doc_title,heading23,See note 3 for reconciliation between internal measures of capability performance – net sales and contribution – and revenue and profit for the financial year,25
doc_title,heading24,"Financial position at the end of the yearThe financial position of the group and partnership has strengthened considerably during the year. As set out on page 3, operations are generally financed by members’ capital and other members’ interests, which together totalled £697 million at 30 September 2021 (2020: £357 million) for the group and £595 million (2020: £277 million) for the partnership. Total members’ interests increased as a result of improved profitability and the retention of profits arising on the disposal of the restructuring business",107
doc_title,heading25,"Whilst bank facilities of £475 million were available to the group at 30 September 2021, the group and partnership held £465 million (2020: £139 million) and £428 million (2020: £101 million) of cash balances respectively and had no borrowings at the year end",57
doc_title,heading26,"The main current assets of the group are trade receivables and contract assets, both of which are monitored across the business. The prompt rendering of fees for work done and collection of the resulting receivables are important aspects of the monitoring of financial risks within the group. These assets totalled £833 million (2020: £740 million) for the group and £801 million (2020: £704 million) for the partnership",85
doc_title,heading27,"Going concernAs set out on page 3, the group has access to considerable financial resources, namely members’ capital, undistributed profits and borrowing facilities. This funding, together with well-established relationships with many clients and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries, leaves the group well placed to manage the financial impact of our business risks, including those that have arisen as a result of COVID-19 and may arise as a result of other wider economic impacts. The resilience measures taken by the group early in the pandemic, including cost containment and enhanced focus on working capital management, together with further measures taken to strengthen our capital structure in 2021, have improved the group’s resilience both in the immediate and longer term",145
doc_title,heading28,"Forecasts have been prepared for the group, for the purpose of assessing going concern through to 30 September 2023, reflecting the group’s business plan. These forecasts reflect a range of downside scenarios and a Plausible but Severe scenario that incorporates a number of impacts, including those arising from a further deterioration of the economy, prolonged impact from COVID-19, regulatory and reputational matters. Whilst the Plausible but Severe scenario reflects a significantly reduced level of trading and revenue growth available to the group, it demonstrates that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability, operating within borrowing facilities and covenants throughout the forecast period without reliance on cost mitigating or liquidity enhancing measures. Should the matters considered as part of the Plausible but Severe scenario significantly worsen, management has the option of reintroducing certain of the measures taken at the outset of the pandemic such as postponing investment spend or deferring payments to partners",185
doc_title,heading29,"At 30 September 2021, the group had cash balances of £465 million (2020: £139 million) and undrawn facilities of £475 million (2020: £475 million) including an additional revolving credit facility of £90 million (2020: £90 million) agreed in April 2020 and expiring in October 2021 . This level of cash and committed, undrawn funding provides strong financial resilience through continued disruption caused by any economic factors and allows the group to actively pursue, respond to and invest in opportunities in line with the group’s business plan. Full details of the borrowing facilities are set out in note 16. Subsequent to the year end, the group has entered into new borrowing facilities as set out in note 27; as a result, unsecured borrowing facilities totalling £385 million are available to the group for five years",169
doc_title,heading30,"The group’s objectives, policies and processes to address risks arising from the group’s use of financial instruments, in particular its exposure to market, credit and liquidity risks are set out in note 22",42
doc_title,heading31,"Having considered the group’s forecasts and the wider business risks faced by the group, (as set out in the group’s separately published Transparency Report) including known events and conditions that may arise beyond the forecast period, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the going concern assessment period",69
doc_title,heading32,"Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing this report and financial statements.Report to the members(continued)4UK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

doc_title,heading33,"BrexitThe Brexit risk has reduced considerably since last year as we have taken significant steps to prepare the firm for the ongoing consequences of the UK leaving the European Union. However, uncertainty remains around the impact of new regulatory and other restrictions that may be implemented by EU member states in future periods and we will continue to evaluate the impact of Brexit on both the group’s activities and those of our clients",79
doc_title,heading34,"Whilst the longer term political and economic effect of leaving the EU will only become clearer over time, we do not expect either our ability to deliver services or the quality of services delivered to be significantly impacted under the future rules on trade, travel and business with the EU",53
doc_title,heading35,"Environmental and sustainability The group recognises the importance of its environmental responsibilities and has policies and initiatives in place designed to minimise the impact of the group on the environment. We believe that sustainable growth is the only way to build a successful business and have a lasting impact on the world. Our published Impact Plan brings together all of KPMG UK’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments and sets out our impact, the progress we are making and where we hold ourselves to account to go further",105

doc_title,heading37,Statement of members’ responsibilities in respect of the report to the members and the financial statementsThe members are responsible for preparing the report to the members and the group and partnership financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations,43
doc_title,heading38,The Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2008 (the 2008 Regulations) require the members to prepare the group and partnership financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the members have elected to prepare both the group and partnership financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006,80
doc_title,heading39,"Under Regulation 8 of the 2008 Regulations the members must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and partnership and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.In preparing each of the group and partnership financial statements, the members are required to: —Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; —Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; —State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; —Assess the group and partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and —Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the partnership or to cease operation, or have no realistic alternative but to do so",178
doc_title,heading40,Under Regulation 6 of the 2008 Regulations the members are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the partnership’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the partnership and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with those regulations,56
doc_title,heading41,"They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities",65
doc_title,heading42,"The members are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the group’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. During the year, these responsibilities were exercised by the Board on behalf of the members",60
doc_title,heading43,"Disclosure of information to the auditorThe Board members who held office at the date of approval of these financial statements confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the group’s auditor is unaware; each Board member has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the group’s auditor is aware of that information",88

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the partnership financial statements, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, as applied to limited liability partnerships",171

We are independent of the group and the partnership in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion",105
doc_title,heading48,"Conclusions relating to going concernWe are responsible for concluding on the appropriateness of the members’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify the auditor’s opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group or the partnership to cease to continue as a going concern",154
doc_title,heading49,"In our evaluation of the members’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks associated with the group’s and the partnership’s business model including effects arising from macro-economic uncertainties such as Brexit and COVID-19, we assessed and challenged the reasonableness of estimates made by the members and the related disclosures and analysed how those risks might affect the group’s and partnership’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period",94
doc_title,heading50,"Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue",65

doc_title,heading58,Key audit mattersThe partnership’s members have requested us to expand our auditor’s report to report under ISA (UK) 701 ‘Communicating Key Audit Matters in the Independent Auditor’s Report’. This involves communicating to the members key audit matters together with other audit planning and scoping matters,65
doc_title,heading59,"Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters",119

doc_title,heading62,"The group’s revenue amounted to £2,433 million (2020: £2,303 million)",22
doc_title,heading63,"The majority of the group’s revenue is derived from contracts where the consideration is based on time and materials. For these contracts, the group satisfies performance obligations over time and revenue is recognised in proportion to cost incurred relative to total expected cost required to complete the satisfaction of that performance obligation",57
doc_title,heading64,In determining the timing of revenue to be recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ each individual engagement team estimates the stage of completion and the right to consideration at the year-end for each contract. The level of judgement and estimation required is higher when related to contracts with complexities arising from variable consideration or where contracts remain open at the year end,76
doc_title,heading65,"We identified a population of significant contracts with specific risks or characteristics as set out above (such as variable consideration) with revenue recognised amounting to £231 million which, in our view, had a greater susceptibility to material misstatement arising from the risk of fraud or error",53
doc_title,heading66,"Relevant disclosures in the Financial Statements 2021 —Note 3, RevenueIn responding to the key audit matter, we performed the following audit procedures: —gaining an understanding of the processes and relevant controls implemented by management to identify, measure and recognise revenue, including unbilled revenue; assessing the design effectiveness of those processes and controls and testing the operating effectiveness of relevant year end controls; —assessing the accounting policies and practices relating to revenue recognition employed by management to ensure compliance with IFRS 15; —testing a sample of engagements to assess that the right to consideration had been obtained through performance of the agreed services and that the associated revenues were appropriately recognised under the requirements of IFRS 15; —for the individually significant engagements where we identified specific risks or characteristics, discussing, challenging and corroborating the estimates applied by engagement and management teams in determining the level of revenue recognised in the consolidated income statement and the related contract assets and liabilities within the group and partnership statements of financial position; and —making enquiries of engagement and management teams where revenues recognised or trends fell outside our expectation parameters. We sought corroborating evidence to support explanations provided by those teams",228

We determined that specified audit procedures on QSM was required to provide sufficient, appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole, as it makes provision for a number of professional claims and regulatory matters. Detailed audit instructions were sent to the component auditor of QSM setting out the scope and nature of the audit and the group risks that should be addressed. We also communicated information required to be reported back to the group engagement team, together with the group materiality threshold (in the knowledge that this component is subject to local audit using a materiality set at a lower level than group financial statement materiality). We also evaluated the component auditor’s working papers and held direct discussions with them regarding their findings and conclusions",221

doc_title,heading118,"This description forms part of our auditor’s report.Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraudIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements in the financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with ISAs (UK)",120
doc_title,heading119,"The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below: We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined the most significant laws and regulations to be:  —those that relate to the reporting framework (International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applied to Limited Liability Partnerships)",78

doc_title,heading127,"These audit procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error and detecting irregularities that result from fraud is inherently more difficult than detecting those that result from error, as fraud may involve collusion, deliberate concealment, forgery or intentional misrepresentations. Also, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it",112
doc_title,heading128,The engagement partner has assessed that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence and capabilities to identify or recognise non-compliance with laws and regulations and this was achieved through adherence to internal quality control procedures and through planning and stand back meetings to identify and follow up on non-compliance risks,55

doc_title,heading158,"Going ConcernAs set out in the Report to the members, the group has access to considerable financial resources, namely members’ capital, undistributed profits and borrowings. This funding, together with well-established relationships with many clients and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries, leaves the group well placed to manage the financial impact of our business risks, including those that have arisen as a result of COVID-19 and may arise as a result of other wider economic impacts. The resilience measures taken by the group early in the pandemic, including cost containment and enhanced focus on working capital management, together with further measures taken to strengthen our capital structure in 2021, have improved the group’s resilience both in the immediate and longer term",148
doc_title,heading159,"Forecasts have been prepared for the group, for the purpose of assessing going concern through to 30 September 2023, reflecting the group’s business plan. These forecasts reflect a range of downside scenarios and a Plausible but Severe scenario that incorporates a number of impacts, including those arising from a further deterioration of the economy, prolonged impact from COVID-19, regulatory and reputational matters. Whilst the Plausible but Severe scenario reflects a significantly reduced level of trading and revenue growth available to the group, it demonstrates that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability, operating within borrowing facilities and covenants throughout the forecast period without reliance on cost mitigating or liquidity enhancing measures. Should the matters considered as part of the Plausible but Severe scenario significantly worsen, management has the option of reintroducing certain of the measures taken at the outset of the pandemic such as postponing investment spend or deferring payments to partners",185
doc_title,heading160,"At 30 September 2021, the group had cash balances of £465 million (2020: £139 million) and undrawn facilities of £475 million (2020: £475 million) including an additional revolving credit facility of £90 million (2020: £90 million) agreed in April 2020 and expiring in October 2021; this level of cash and committed, undrawn funding provides strong financial resilience through continued disruption caused by any economic factors and allows the group to actively pursue, respond to and invest in opportunities in line with the group’s business plan. Full details of the borrowing facilities are set out in note 16. Subsequent to the year end, the group has entered into new borrowing facilities as set out in note 27; as a result, unsecured borrowing facilities totalling £385 million are available to the group for five years",169

doc_title,heading175,"NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statements2.

doc_title,heading176,"These judgements and significant estimates are based on historical experience and other factors, including market data and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable and constitute management’s best assessment at the date of the financial statements.

doc_title,heading187," —Impairment of intangible assets: recoverable amount of goodwill does not change significantly if underlying assumptions used in the calculation of value in use are changed, as indicated in note 11 .

doc_title,heading189,NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statements3. Revenue All revenue of the group and partnership is generated from contracts with customers,25
doc_title,heading190,"Accounting policy Revenue is recognised when, or as, the group and partnership satisfy performance obligations, contained in contracts with clients, by transferring control of services to clients. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable for satisfying those performance obligations, including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax",61
doc_title,heading191,"Recoverable expenses represent charges from other KPMG International member firms, sub-contractors and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in respect of assignments and expected to be recovered from clients",38
doc_title,heading192,"Revenue is recognised at an amount that depicts the transaction price of the transfer of professional services to a customer. Variable consideration, such as fee arrangements contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not be required when the uncertainties determining the level of variable consideration are subsequently resolved",78
doc_title,heading193,"The majority of the group’s revenue is derived from contracts where the consideration is based on time and materials. For these contracts the group satisfies performance obligations over time and revenue is recognised as services are provided at the rate agreed with the client, provided there is an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date",63
doc_title,heading194,"Similarly, revenue derived from fixed fee contracts is recognised over time based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period relative to total services to be provided, generally assessed by reference to actual inputs of time and expenses as a proportion of the total expected inputs, where there is an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date",67
doc_title,heading195,"For contingent fee contracts, including certain Deal Advisory engagements where the group are providing deal support, consideration is constrained in estimating revenue and recognised at a point in time when the contingency is resolved and the firm has an entitlement to payment",44
doc_title,heading196,"Where contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price, reflecting expected cost-plus margin if a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable",42
doc_title,heading197,"Invoices are issued in accordance with the terms of engagement; except where consideration is variable, fees are usually billed on account based on a payment schedule and standard payment terms are usually 30 days from date of issue. Where revenue recognised by the group and partnership exceeds the amounts invoiced, a ‘Contract asset’ is recognised within ‘Trade and other receivables’",78
doc_title,heading198,Consideration received or amounts due in excess of revenue recognised by the group and partnership are classified as ‘Contract liabilities’ within ‘Trade and other payables’,35
doc_title,heading199,Contract assets are reclassified as trade receivables when invoiced or when the consideration becomes unconditional because only the passage of time is required before payment is due,32
doc_title,heading200,"Significant estimateIn calculating revenue from service contracts, the group and partnership make certain estimates as to the extent to which performance obligations have been satisfied. In doing so, the group and partnership estimate the remaining time and external costs to be incurred in completing contracts and the clients’ willingness and ability to pay for the services provided. These estimates depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change",84
doc_title,heading201,"Certain service contracts, notably those in Deal Advisory, Consulting and Tax & Legal, require a greater degree of estimation than others, specifically those contracts that: —are long-term, spanning a number of accounting periods, thereby extending the period over which estimation is required; —have fee arrangements other than a simple time and materials basis, requiring an estimation as to percentage completion over time;  —have multiple deliverables, such as software implementation and support services, requiring an estimate as to revenue allocation to each deliverable or percentage completion over time if the contract is considered to be a single performance obligation",119
doc_title,heading202,"Estimates of revenue, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Estimates are updated at each reporting date, including application of any constraint in respect of variable consideration until the uncertainty is resolved. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the income statement in the period in which the circumstances arose",66
doc_title,heading203,A different assessment of these estimates may impact the carrying value of contract assets recognised of £339 million (2020: £329 million) for the group and £331 million (2020: £313 million) for the partnership at 30 September 2021 . A 5% movement in contract assets would result in a change in revenue of £17 million for group and £16 million for partnership,74

If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is presented in the income statement as a financial expense",129
doc_title,heading305,Contingent liabilities arise where the outflow of resources is considered less than probable or cannot be measured reliably,23
doc_title,heading306,Property provisionsProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the group or partnership from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.

doc_title,heading311,"JudgementIn addition to former partner annuities, the Operating Provisions of the partnership allow for one-off member retirement payments to current retiring partners in certain circumstances, subject to prior approval by the Executive Committee. Management have assessed that no provision is required for future member retirement payments as these payments reflect an additional profit share and as such there is no additional outflow of resources required to settle the obligation. A different judgement taken in this respect would result in recognition of a liability classified as Amounts due to members; a high-level actuarial exercise estimates that such a provision could be around £66 million at 30 September 2021 (2020: £60 million)",132

doc_title,heading332,20. Retirement benefitsAccounting policyThe group operates two defined contribution pension plans for which the charge for the year represents the contributions payable to the plans in respect of the accounting period. An accrual or prepayment is included in the statement of financial position to the extent to which such costs do not equate to the cash contributions paid in the year,70
doc_title,heading333,The group also operates two defined benefit pension plans for which the partnership is the sponsoring employer and bears all related risks. Both plans are closed to future accrual of benefits. The group’s net obligations in respect of its defined benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the benefits that former employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of plan assets (at bid price) is deducted,96
doc_title,heading334,The group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability for the period based on a spot rate approach. Under this approach the full yield curve which has been used to derive the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is applied to the expected cash flows from the pension schemes in each year. This gives an average rate of interest which is applied to the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the annual period adjusted for contributions and benefit payments during the period,92
doc_title,heading335,The discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation is based on a yield curve which has been derived based on information regarding AA-rated corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. The group determines a single equivalent discount rate based on this yield curve being applied to sample pension scheme cash flows that broadly match the profile of the group’s pension schemes. The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method,84
doc_title,heading336,"When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the income statement when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs",53

Analysis carried out by the Scheme Actuary has also informed the revised demographic assumptions used in these financial disclosures. The Trustee of the TMcL plan and the group agreed at the time of the 2017 valuation that future expenses for the TMcL plan are met by the plan and this practice has continued following the completion of the 2020 valuation",146

doc_title,heading358,"Minimum funding requirementsThe group and partnership have determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defined benefit plans, the group has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus from the TMcL plan under IFRIC 14.11 (b), assuming the gradual settlement of plan liabilities over time until all members have left the plan. The group does not have an unconditional right to a refund of surplus from the pre-2000 fund. However, since both the defined benefit plans are in deficit and the deficit in the pre-2000 fund exceeds the present value of future committed contributions, IFRIC 14 has no impact on the pension liabilities or disclosures (2020: £nil) at 30 September 2021 ",141

doc_title,heading360,"NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statementsRisksThe pension plans expose the group to several key risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:Default risk  – the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan have a fully credit-based investment strategy based on buying and holding credit instruments which are expected to deliver the income required in order to pay members’ pensions, reducing the volatility of the financial position of the schemes. One of the key risks of this type of ‘buy and hold’ strategy is default risk: the risk that the credit instruments don’t deliver the expected income due to default. This risk is managed by investing primarily in investment grade credit instruments which are expected to have a lower risk of default as well as investing in a well diversified portfolio of assets",162
doc_title,heading361,"Reinvestment risk  – the ‘buy and hold’ strategy mentioned above generates excess asset income in the short-term which would need to be reinvested in the future in order to continue meeting the expected benefits for members over the longer term. There is a risk that this income is reinvested at worse terms than assumed, which might mean that further contributions are required from the group in the future. The scenario where this may apply (narrowing credit spreads) is likely to be during a more buoyant economic environment which is likely to be beneficial for the group more generally",117
doc_title,heading362,Mortality risk  – the assumptions adopted by the group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy,19
doc_title,heading363,"However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan and consequently increases in the liabilities. The group and Trustee of each plan review the mortality assumptions on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption",64
doc_title,heading364,"The group has updated their mortality assumption as at 30 September 2021 to reflect the latest available data from the CMI, however, no explicit change has been made for the potential effects of COVID-19 as there remains uncertainty around the impact the pandemic will have on long term mortality rates for the pension plan members",62
doc_title,heading365,Other mattersThe group expects to contribute approximately £4.5 million (which is made up entirely of payments from the ABF arrangement – see below) to its defined benefit pension plans in the next financial year,41
doc_title,heading366,"Effective from 29 September 2014, KPMG LLP entered into an ABF agreement with the pension plans through the establishment of a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP)",32
doc_title,heading367,"Under this agreement, the beneficial interest in certain trade receivables to a fair value of £90 million was transferred to the SLP . The transfer was effected via a receivables purchase 20. Retirement benefits (continued)agreement, which sets out how £90 million of the group’s receivables will be transferred to the SLP for a 25-year period from the date of implementation",83
doc_title,heading368,The plans have a limited interest in the SLP and are entitled to combined annual distribution from the profits of the SLP of £4.5 million (£3.9 million pre-2000 fund; £0.6 million TMcL plan) payable monthly for 25 years from the date of implementation. The payments to a plan will cease if it reaches a fully funded status determined using a low-risk measure of the plan’s liabilities,89
doc_title,heading369,"The SLP is controlled by the group and its results are consolidated by the group. The group’s statement of financial position, IAS 19 deficit and income statement are unchanged by the establishment of the SLP . The investment held by the plans in the SLP does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the group’s financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets. The value of the trade receivables transferred to the SLP remains on the group’s statement of financial position",109
doc_title,heading370,"As a result of the transactions under the ABF , the partnership’s statement of financial position, at the inception of the agreement, was changed to reflect its receivable from the SLP of £30 million, prepayment of contributions to the pension funds of £60 million and a liability of £90 million arising under the receivables purchase agreement. The IAS 19 deficit and income statement were unchanged",83
doc_title,heading371,"Because taxation in the partnership is a personal liability of the individual members, no deferred tax on the plans’ balances falls to be recorded in the financial statements of both the group and partnership",37
doc_title,heading372,"The High Court ruled on 26 October 2018 in the landmark Lloyds Banking Group case on the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs). The judgement requires equalisation between men and women for the effect of unequal GMPs and the impact of this decision was accounted for in the disclosures. This did not affect the pre-2000 fund but affects the TMcL plan, as this arrangement was contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. On 20 November 2020, the High Court handed down a further judgment confirming that defined benefit schemes which provide GMPs need to revisit and, where necessary, top-up historical Cash Equivalent Transfer Values that were calculated based on unequalised benefits. The group has allowed for this additional liability of £0.2m as a past service cost recognised in the income statement in the current year",169

doc_title,heading445,"The group and partnership recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and, if relevant, an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received",99
doc_title,heading446,"The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. The estimated useful life of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability",86
doc_title,heading447,"The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group and partnership’s incremental borrowing rate",52
doc_title,heading448,"Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:  —fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;  —variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;  —the exercise price under a purchase option that the group and partnership are reasonably certain to exercise;  —lease payments in an optional renewal period if the group and partnership are reasonably certain to exercise an extension option; and  —penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group and partnership are reasonably certain not to terminate early.The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured if the group and partnership changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option",164
doc_title,heading449,"When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero",53

doc_title,heading452,"As a lessorAs an intermediate lessor, the group and partnership accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the group and partnership applied the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease",98

doc_title,heading456,"The most significant impact of management’s assessment regarding the exercise of the extension or terminate options relates to office buildings. Where practicable, the group and partnership seek to include an extension or terminate option in new leases to provide operational flexibility.

The group and partnership assess at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise either the extension or termination options.

doc_title,heading493,The scope of the report includes KPMG’s operations in the UK excluding the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. We use electronic data collection processes to gather our data,33
doc_title,heading494,"Where data does not exist for a full 12-month reporting period we have estimated outstanding data by extrapolating known data. Our method for calculating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is based on the GHG Protocol standards and guidance documents. We use carbon conversion factors issued annually by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to report carbon emissions",74
doc_title,heading495,"Energy consumption and associated carbon emissions in this period has been materially affected by the impact of COVID-19, however we have continued to work proactively to reduce our energy consumption and our carbon emissions where possible. In September 2021 we received re-certification to the ISO14001, the standard for Environmental Management Systems (EMS). Alongside our certification to ISO50001, the standard for Energy Management Systems, we are able to monitor and report energy consumption and total environmental impact more effectively, as well as identify areas for continual improvement",106
doc_title,heading496,"Despite the challenge of the pandemic emissions reduction activities have been implemented across our offices including a Building Management System upgrade in our Leeds office, LED implementation in our Canary Wharf Head Office and upgrades to our Air Handling Units. Our engineers also benefit from an auto approval mechanism for projects with a three-year payback, this allows them to capitalise on opportunities across the estate",74
doc_title,heading497,"This year the business continued to deploy a predominantly remote-working model, necessitated by the global pandemic. From September 2021 onwards, the business entered a ‘Reconnection Phase’, introducing hybrid-working to the firm with employees able to attend KPMG offices four days a fortnight. Use of collaboration technology has continued in earnest, with a 99% uptake across the firm in Microsoft Teams. This is now established as the default method of business communication and interaction, with this intended to remain the case for a period of time as society continues to live with the global pandemic. This has seen a significant shift in mindset and behaviours, with business travel reducing considerably as a result of the pandemic. In the reporting period, we have seen trends of significant reduction in our electricity and gas consumption, as well as in the production of waste in our different waste streams",178
doc_title,heading498,"This is as a result of low occupation of KPMG offices due to government and business requirements to stay at home and work remotely as a result of the global pandemic. Similarly, our business travel across all forms of transport has reduced due to the effects of the global pandemic. Across some of our offices we have seen an increase in water consumption, owing to the need to regularly flush taps, bathrooms, kitchen facilities and vending machines across our estate. This is due to them not being used in a regular capacity by the volumes of colleagues which have traditionally occupied the offices",114
doc_title,heading499,"We continue to purchase renewable energy for our managed estate, and this year collaborated with our landlords in our leased buildings on renewable energy purchasing, in line with the Scope 1 and 2 elements of our Science-Based Targets.

doc_title,heading507,Report to the membersThe Board submits its report together with the audited consolidated financial statements of KPMG LLP and its subsidiary undertakings (the group) for the year ended 30 September 2020,39
doc_title,heading508,Legal structureKPMG LLP is the UK member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International. Each member firm is a separate and independent legal entity and describes itself as such. All member firms are committed to following common standards in the provision of services for clients and to maintaining the highest levels of independence and integrity,73
doc_title,heading509,KPMG LLP is incorporated in the UK as a limited liability partnership under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 and is referred to in these financial statements as ‘the partnership’,38
doc_title,heading510,"The partnership’s registered office is 15 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5GL",22
doc_title,heading511,"Principal activitiesThe principal activities of the group are the provision of professional services, notably audit, tax and legal, deal advisory and consulting. The group operates primarily through the partnership and its subsidiary undertakings, predominantly in the UK but also has operations in other countries as client contracts require (see note 27)",61
doc_title,heading512,"GovernanceDuring the year ended 30 September 2020, the governance structure of the partnership comprised: —The Board, supported by various sub-committees including the Audit Committee, is the main governance body of the group, responsible for overseeing the stewardship, accountability and leadership of the group, providing clear-sighted counsel on the strategic direction of the group and alignment to its vision, values and purpose",78
doc_title,heading513," —The Executive Board, supported by four Executive Committees, is responsible for driving the board-approved strategy for the group and lead on issues that cut across the group",32
doc_title,heading514,"Full details of the governance structures, including changes in year, as well as the composition and responsibilities of the Board and related committees can be found on the group’s website and in the group’s separately published Transparency Report.Designated membersThe designated members (as defined in the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000) of the partnership during the year were:Bill Michael Jeremy BartonTim JonesSarah Willows (resigned 31 January 2020)Members’ capital, profit shares and drawingsThe group is financed through a combination of members’ capital, undistributed profits and borrowing facilities",119
doc_title,heading515,Members’ capital is provided by each member on becoming a partner and is only repayable on retirement or resignation so remains relatively stable from year to year,30
doc_title,heading516,"During the year, members receive monthly drawings and, from time to time, additional profit share distributions. The level and timing of the additional distributions are decided by the Executive Board and approved by the Board, taking into account the group’s cash requirements for operating and investing activities",55
doc_title,heading517,"The remuneration model is designed to drive and reward one-firm behaviour consistent with our strategy and values, reflect an individual’s medium-term value as well as current year performance against their goals, and promote clarity and transparency amongst members regarding their own remuneration and that of other members. A member’s remuneration generally comprises three elements as described below based on benchmark pay. Benchmark pay is communicated to members in November/December each year and is determined in relation to an individual’s medium-term value to the group",113
doc_title,heading518,"Each member’s benchmark pay is determined with quality as the primary factor and with other factors such as past performance, market value of skill set, individual capability, leadership qualities and overall contribution to the group taken into account",44
doc_title,heading519,The profit allocated to members is distributed as follows:Basic profit share  – each member will receive 60% of their benchmark pay;One Firm Profit Share  – each member will receive an agreed percentage of their benchmark pay (the same percentage applies to all members);Discretionary Profit Share (DPS)  – in total the same amount as for the One Firm Profit Share is allocated to members on the basis of their relative in-year performance against their balanced scorecard goals,95

doc_title,heading521,"Report to the members  (continued)These elements account for the majority of the total profit allocated to members. The remainder was allocated to those members who retired in the year, and who received an additional profit share in line with the KPMG LLP partnership agreement. A deduction is made from the total pay for any members if their behaviour, quality or performance has fallen below the levels expected by the Executive Board, as indicated by adverse Quality and Risk metrics",93
doc_title,heading522,"Financial performance during the yearRevenue fell to £2,303 million (2019: £2,398 million), a reduction of 4% year on year; on a like for like basis, allowing for the disposal of the pensions business, net sales reduced by 1% to £1,953 million (2019: £1,973 million), reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the second half of our financial year. Three of our four capabilities experienced a decline in net sales as client engagements were paused at the onset of the pandemic; only Audit achieved growth in net sales, at 3%. See note 4 for net sales and contribution by capability and reconciliation between revenue and net sales",142
doc_title,heading523,"As the crisis started to unfold from April 2020, we implemented a set of operational and financial resilience measures to help offset the drop in revenue. Measures such as reducing contractors and temporary staff, pausing external hire, moving offices to skeleton operations and reducing discretionary spend all contributed to a profit before taxation and members’ profit shares of £403 million (2019: £307 million), or £288 million excluding the profit on disposal of the pensions advisory business. On a like for like basis, this represented a 6% reduction in profit before taxation and a considerably better outturn than was forecast earlier in the pandemic",121
doc_title,heading524,"Financial position at the end of the yearThe financial position of the group remains strong at 30 September 2020. As set out on page 3, operations are generally financed by members’ capital and other members’ interests, which together totalled £357 million at 30 September 2020 (2019: £296 million) for the group and £277 million (2019: £225 million) for the partnership, having increased as a result of the retention of the profit arising on the disposal of the pensions advisory business",100
doc_title,heading525,"Bank facilities of £475 million were also available to the group at 30 September 2020, having increased by £90 million in April 2020. The group’s operating activities are generally cash generative; the borrowing of £220 million outstanding at 30 September 2019 has been repaid in full during the year",59
doc_title,heading526,"The group’s and partnership’s gross assets have increased to £1,665 million (2019: £1,308 million) and £1,678 million (2019: £1,351 million) respectively as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, bringing all significant leases on-balance sheet; gross liabilities have similarly increased to £1,313 million (2019: £1,016 million) for group and £1,401 million (2019: £1,126 million) for partnership, reflecting the present value of the lease commitments",114
doc_title,heading527,"The main current assets of the group are trade receivables and contract assets, both of which are monitored across the business. The prompt rendering of fees for work done and collection of the resulting receivables are important aspects of the monitoring of financial risks within the group. These assets totalled £740 million (2019: £889 million) for the group and £704 million (2019: £853 million) for the partnership",86
doc_title,heading528,"Going concernAs set out above, the group has access to considerable financial resources, namely members’ capital, undistributed profits and borrowings. This funding, together with well-established relationships with many clients and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries, leaves the group well placed to manage the financial impact of our business risks, including those that have arisen as a result of COVID-19 and may arise as a result of Brexit. The resilience measures taken early in the pandemic, including liquidity enhancing measures such as deferral of payments to partners, have improved both our immediate and longer-term resilience. At the date of this report, the majority of our staff and partners continue to work remotely as we continue to follow guidance issued by the UK government",151
doc_title,heading529,"Despite these challenges, we do not expect client service delivery to be materially affected following the effective transition to remote working",22
doc_title,heading530,"Forecasts have been prepared for the group for the 21 months through to 30 September 2022, reflecting on the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible impact on the group’s operational activities, liquidity, borrowing facilities and related covenant requirements. These forecasts reflect a range of downside scenarios, including a Plausible but Severe scenario that demonstrates that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability without exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants throughout the forecast period when liquidity enhancing measures that are readily available to the group are taken into account. Other downside scenarios demonstrate that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability without exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants throughout the forecast period without the need to implement any further cost mitigation or liquidity enhancing measures",143
doc_title,heading531,"At 30 September 2020, the group had undrawn facilities of £475 million (2019: £165 million) including an additional revolving credit facility of £90 million (2019: £nil) advanced in April 2020 and expiring in October 2021, with an option to extend to October 2022; this level of committed, undrawn funding provides strong financial resilience through continued disruption caused by the pandemic and when the time is right, allows the group to actively pursue, respond to and invest in opportunities in line with the strategy of the group. Full details of the borrowing facilities are set out in note 17 ",120

Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing this report and financial statements",99

doc_title,heading540,The Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2008 (the 2008 Regulations) require the members to prepare the group and partnership financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the members have elected to prepare both the group and partnership financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and applicable law,79
doc_title,heading541,"Under Regulation 8 of the 2008 Regulations the members must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and partnership and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.In preparing each of the group and partnership financial statements, the members are required to: —Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; —Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; —State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;  —Assess the group and partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and —Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the partnership or to cease operation, or have no realistic alternative but to do so",175
doc_title,heading542,Under Regulation 6 of the 2008 Regulations the members are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the partnership’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the partnership and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with those regulations,56
doc_title,heading543,"They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities",65
doc_title,heading544,"The members are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the group’s website.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘ Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report",198
doc_title,heading551,"We are independent of the group and the partnership in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

doc_title,heading552,"The impact of macro-economic uncertainties on our auditOur audit of the financial statements requires us to obtain an understanding of all relevant uncertainties, including those arising as a consequence of the effects of macro-economic uncertainties such as COVID-19 and Brexit",51
doc_title,heading553,All audits assess and challenge the reasonableness of estimates made by the members and the related disclosures and the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements. All of these depend on assessments of the future economic environment and the group’s and the partnership’s future prospects and performance,63
doc_title,heading554,"COVID-19 and Brexit are amongst the most significant economic events currently faced by the UK, and at the date of this report their effects are subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty, with the full range of possible outcomes and their impacts unknown. We applied a standardised firm-wide approach in response to these uncertainties when assessing the group’s and the partnership’s future prospects and performance. However, no audit should be expected to predict the unknowable factors or all possible future implications for a group and a partnership associated with these particular events",109

doc_title,heading556,"Independent auditor’s report to the members of KPMG LLP (continued)Conclusions relating to going concernWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: —the members’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or —the members have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group’s or the partnership’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.In our evaluation of the member’ conclusions, we considered the risks associated with the group’s and partnership’s business, including effects arising from macro-economic uncertainties such as COVID-19 and Brexit, and analysed how those risks might affect the group’s and partnership’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. In accordance with the above, we have nothing to report in these respects",243
doc_title,heading557,"However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report is not a guarantee that the group or the partnership will continue in operation",64
doc_title,heading558,"Overview of our audit approach —Overall materiality: £11 .5 million, which represented 5% of the group’s profit before taxation, disposal of business and members’ profit share, at the planning stage of the audit. We decided not to revise materiality once the final results were known; —Key audit matters were identified as revenue recognition includes the risk of fraud, professional claims and regulatory matters, impairment of goodwill, and going concern; and —We performed a full scope audit of the financial statements of the partnership and on the financial information of certain significant subsidiaries. We completed specified or analytical audit procedures on the financial information of all other subsidiaries",131
doc_title,heading559,Key audit mattersThe partnership’s members have requested us to expand our auditor’s report to report under ISA (UK) 701 ‘Communicating Key Audit Matters in the Independent Auditor’s Report’. This involves communicating to the members key audit matters together with other audit planning and scoping matters,65
doc_title,heading560,"Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters",121

For these contracts, the group satisfies performance obligations over time and revenue is recognised in proportion to cost incurred relative to total expected cost required to complete the satisfaction of that performance obligation",57
doc_title,heading565,"In determining the timing of revenue to be recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ each individual engagement team estimates the stage of completion and the right to consideration at the year-end for each contract. The level of judgement and estimation required is higher when related to revenues which remain unbilled to the customer at the year end. The value of revenue recognised at the year end, which remained unbilled, amounted to £310 million (2019: £334 million) for the group",103
doc_title,heading566,"Within this population we identified a further population of significant contracts with specific risks or characteristics with unbilled revenue recognised amounting to £223 million for the group which, in our view, had a greater susceptibility to material misstatement arising from the risk of fraud or error",52
doc_title,heading567,"We therefore identified revenue recognition includes the risk of fraud as a significant risk for this population of contracts which was one of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement.Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: —gaining an understanding of the processes and relevant controls implemented by management to identify, measure and recognise revenue, including unbilled revenue; assessing the design effectiveness of those processes and controls and testing the operating effectiveness of certain key controls; —assessing the accounting policies and practices relating to revenue recognition to establish compliance with IFRS 15; —performing substantive testing on a sample of engagements to assess that the right to consideration had been obtained through performance of the agreed services; —for individually significant engagements where we identified specific risks or characteristics, discussing and challenging the estimates applied by engagement and management teams in determining the level of revenue recognised in the consolidated income statement and the unbilled revenue recognised within the group and partnership statements of financial position; —making enquiries of engagement and management teams where revenues recognised or trends fell outside our expectation parameters. We sought corroborating evidence to support explanations provided by those teams; and —considering the adequacy of the disclosures related to revenue recognition",235
doc_title,heading568,Key observationsOur audit testing did not identify any significant deficiencies in the revenue recognition policies and practices and we did not identify a material misstatement in revenue recognition as a result of the risk of fraud,38
doc_title,heading569,"Overall, our assessment is that the estimates applied in determining the level of revenue resulted in an appropriate level of revenue recognised in the consolidated income statement and unbilled revenue within the group and partnership statements of financial position",42

Group and partnership provisions in this respect amounted to £92 million (2019: £73 million) and £87 million (2019: £68 million) respectively,102
doc_title,heading573,"In accordance with IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, a provision is made for the estimated costs for dealing with and settling professional claims and regulatory matters when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. This can be highly judgemental",98

doc_title,heading580,"Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, goodwill must be subjected to an annual impairment review. In performing that impairment review, management compare the recoverable amount of the goodwill with its net book value.

The impairment assessment process, including the estimation of recoverable amount utilises both valuation techniques and forecasting models which include a number of estimates and uncertainties",98

We determined that a full scope audit of QSM was required to provide sufficient, appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole, as it makes provision for a number of professional claims and regulatory matters. Detailed audit instructions were sent to the component auditor of QSM setting out the full scope nature of the audit and the group risks that should be addressed.

The resilience measures taken early in the pandemic, including liquidity enhancing measures such as deferral of payments to partners, have improved our immediate and longer-term resilience. At the date of this report, the majority of our staff and partners continue to work remotely as we continue to follow guidance issued by the UK government. Despite these challenges, we do not expect client service delivery to be materially affected following the effective transition to remote working",143
doc_title,heading645,"Forecasts have been prepared for the group for the 21 months through to 30 September 2022, reflecting on the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible impact on the group’s operational activities, liquidity, borrowing facilities and related covenant requirements. These forecasts reflect a range of downside scenarios, including a Plausible but Severe scenario that demonstrates that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability without exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants throughout the forecast period when liquidity enhancing measures that are readily available to the group are taken into account. Other downside scenarios demonstrate that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability without exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants throughout the forecast period without the need to implement any further cost mitigation or liquidity enhancing measures.At 30 September 2020, the group had undrawn facilities of £475 million (2019: £165 million) including an additional revolving credit facility of £90 million (2019: £nil) advanced in April 2020 and expiring in October 2021, with an option to extend to October 2022; this level of committed, undrawn funding provides strong financial resilience through continued disruption caused by the pandemic and, when the time is right, allows the group to actively pursue, respond to and invest in opportunities in line with the strategy of the group.

If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated",74
doc_title,heading652,For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time,14
doc_title,heading653,"The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset",66
doc_title,heading654,"For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the cash-generating unit (or CGU)). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs",78
doc_title,heading655,"Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.

doc_title,heading656,"An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.

Changes in significant accounting policiesThe group and partnership have initially applied IFRS 16 from 1 October 2019. As a result, the group and partnership have changed their accounting policy for lease contracts as detailed below",86
doc_title,heading660,"IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (IFRS 16)The group and partnership have initially applied IFRS 16 from 1 October 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at 1 October 2019",52
doc_title,heading661,"Definition of a leasePreviously, the group and partnership determined at contract inception whether an arrangement is or contains a lease under IFRIC 4. Under IFRS 16, the group and partnership assess whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition of a lease, as explained in note 24",59
doc_title,heading662,"On transition to IFRS 16, the group and partnership elected to apply the practical expedient to apply IFRS 16 only to contracts that were previously identified as leases",32

doc_title,heading664,"As a lesseeThe group and partnership previously classified leases as operating leases based on its assessment that the lease did not transfer significantly all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the group and partnership. Under IFRS 16, the group and partnership recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases – these leases are therefore recognised on-balance sheet",76
doc_title,heading665,"Leases classified as operating leases under IAS 17At transition, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the group’s and partnership’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 October 2019.

doc_title,heading666,NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statementsThe group and partnership used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17: —Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics,51
doc_title,heading667, —Applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term,26
doc_title,heading668," —Applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases of low value assets (for example, IT equipment)",29
doc_title,heading669, —Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application,21
doc_title,heading670, —Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease,19
doc_title,heading671,"As a LessorThe group and partnership are a sub-lessor (intermediate lessor) of certain right-of-use assets. Under IFRS 16, the group and partnership are required to assess the classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset, not the underlying asset. On transition, the group and partnership reassessed the classification of a sub-lease contract previously classified as an operating lease under IAS 17 . The group and partnership concluded that the sub-lease is an operating lease under IFRS 16",111
doc_title,heading672,"The group and partnership apply IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ to allocate consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component.Sale-and-leaseback Under IFRS 16, the group and partnership continue to account for the disposal of the property interest at 15 Canada Square completed in January 2018 as a sale-and-leaseback transaction. The group and partnership recognised a right-of-use asset, after adjusting for the rent free amount (reflecting deferred profit) recognised as part of the sale and leaseback transaction, and a lease liability for the leaseback on 1 October 2019, measured in the same way as other right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at that date",146

doc_title,heading690,NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statements4. Revenue All revenue of the group and partnership is generated from contracts with customers,25
doc_title,heading691,Accounting policy Revenue is recognised when the group and partnership have satisfied performance obligations by transferring control of services to clients. Revenue includes recoverable expenses incurred on client assignments but excluding value added tax,37
doc_title,heading692,"Recoverable expenses represent charges from other KPMG International member firms, sub-contractors and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in respect of assignments and expected to be recovered from clients",38
doc_title,heading693,"Revenue is recognised at an amount that depicts the transaction price of the transfer of professional services to a customer. Variable consideration, such as fee arrangements contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event, is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not be required when the uncertainties determining the level of variable consideration are subsequently resolved",78
doc_title,heading694,"The majority of the group’s revenue is derived from contracts where the consideration is based on time and materials. For these contracts the group satisfies performance obligations over time and revenue is recognised based on the rate agreed with the client, provided there is an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date",60
doc_title,heading695,"Similarly, revenue derived from fixed fee contracts is recognised over time based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period relative to total services to be provided, generally assessed by reference to actual inputs of time and expenses as a proportion of the total expected inputs, where there is an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date",67
doc_title,heading696,"For contingent fee contracts, including certain Deal Advisory engagements where the group are providing deal support, consideration is constrained in estimating revenue and recognised at a point in time when the contingency is resolved and the firm has an entitlement to payment",44
doc_title,heading697,"Where contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price, reflecting expected cost plus margin or stand-alone selling price if relevant.Invoices are issued in accordance with the terms of engagement; except where consideration is variable, fees are usually billed on account based on a payment schedule and standard payment terms are usually 30 days from date of issue",81
doc_title,heading698,"Where revenue recognised by the group and partnership exceeds the amounts invoiced, a ‘Contract asset’ is recognised within ‘Trade and other receivables’. Invoices raised in excess of revenue recognised by the group and partnership are classified as ‘Contract liabilities’ within ‘Trade and other payables’",69
doc_title,heading699,"Significant estimateIn calculating revenue from service contracts, the group and partnership make certain estimates as to the extent to which performance obligations have been satisfied. In doing so, the group and partnership estimate the remaining time and external costs to be incurred in completing contracts and the clients’ willingness and ability to pay for the services provided. These estimates depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change",83
doc_title,heading700,"Certain service contracts, notably those in Deal Advisory, Consulting and Tax & Legal, require a greater degree of estimation than others, specifically those contracts that: —are long-term, spanning a number of accounting periods, thereby extending the period over which estimation is required; —have fee arrangements other than a simple time and materials basis, requiring an estimation as to percentage completion over time;  —have multiple deliverables, such as software implementation and support services, requiring an estimate as to revenue allocation to each deliverable or percentage completion over time if the contract is considered to be a single performance obligation",118
doc_title,heading701,"Estimates of revenue, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Estimates are updated at each reporting date, including application of any constraint in respect of variable consideration until the uncertainty is resolved. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the income statement in the period in which the circumstances arose.

Sensitivity analysis on a range of scenarios suggests that any delay in returning to profitable trading or 50% reduction in the level of future growth compared to forecasts would result in an impairment arising against the carrying value of goodwill.

doc_title,heading779,"The amount of the additional flow is determined by a number of variables, the most significant of which is considered to be non-financial in nature. Management has therefore concluded that whilst there is no embedded derivative, the receivable does not meet the ‘solely principal and interest’ test under IFRS 9 and has been recorded at fair value as a FVTPL asset.

Under the agreement the SLP , a group entity set up on inception of the agreement, makes monthly payments totalling £4.5 million per annum to the pension plans for 25 years from the date of implementation.

doc_title,heading782,"In addition, at the inception of the ABF , the partnership contributed £30 million to the SLP which it expects to recover on future termination of the ABF .

At 30 September 2020, the ECL was assessed to be £19 million for the group (2019: £9 million) and £18 million for the partnership (2019: £8 million). However, a different assessment of the probability of default in respect of these clients and industries would result in a different level of ECL; an increase in the weighted average loss rate by 1% would result in recognition of a further £9 million of ECL for both group and partnership",165
doc_title,heading790,Impairment The group and partnership recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets (as defined in IFRS 15). The loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs,53

Retirement benefitsAccounting policyThe group operates two defined contribution pension plans for which the charge for the year represents the contributions payable to the plans in respect of the accounting period. An accrual or prepayment is included in the statement of financial position to the extent to which such costs do not equate to the cash contributions paid in the year,70
doc_title,heading832,The group also operates two defined benefit pension plans for which the partnership is the sponsoring employer and bears all related risks. Both plans are closed to future accrual of benefits. The group’s net obligations in respect of its defined benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the benefits that former employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of plan assets (at bid price) is deducted,96
doc_title,heading833,The group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability for the period based on a spot rate approach,21
doc_title,heading834,Under this approach the full yield curve which has been used to derive the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is applied to the expected cash flows from the pension schemes in each year. This gives an average rate of interest which is applied to the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the annual period adjusted for contributions and benefit payments during the period,70
doc_title,heading835,The discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation is based on a yield curve which has been derived based on information regarding AA-rated corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. The group determines a single equivalent discount rate based on this yield curve being applied to sample pension scheme cash flows that broadly match the profile of the group’s pension schemes. The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method,84

doc_title,heading848,Defined benefit plansThe group and partnership sponsor two defined benefit pension plans. Both pension plans are HMRC registered pension plans and subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.

doc_title,heading849,"In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension plans have appointed a Trustee who is independent of the group. The Trustee of both pension plans is required by law to act in the best interests of the plans’ participants and is responsible for setting certain policies (e.g. investment, contribution and indexation policies) of the plans. The assets of each pension plan are held separately from those of the group, administered by trustee directors of KPMG Pension Trust Company Limited",98

doc_title,heading851,"The Trustee of the plans makes all major strategic decisions including, but not limited to, the plans’ asset allocation and the appointment and termination of fund managers. When making such decisions, and when appropriate, the Trustee takes proper written advice. The Trustee has established an Investment Committee to monitor the operation of the plans’ investment strategy, make day-to-day decisions as necessary for the smooth running of the plans, and make recommendations to the Trustee on overall strategy. This structure has been established in order to ensure that decisions are taken by those who have the appropriate training and expertise",120
doc_title,heading852,The KPMG Staff Pension Fund – pre-April 2000 fundThe KPMG Staff Pension Fund – pre-April 2000 fund (the ‘pre-2000 fund’) provides benefits based on members’ average salary.

The group does not have an unconditional right to a refund of surplus from the pre-2000 fund. However, since both the defined benefit plans are in deficit and the deficit in the pre-2000 fund exceeds the present value of future committed contributions, IFRIC 14 has no impact on the pension liabilities or disclosures (2019: £nil) at 30 September 2020.21 .

doc_title,heading859,"NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statementsRisksThe pension plans expose the group to several key risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: —Default risk  – the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan have a fully credit-based investment strategy based on buying and holding credit instruments which are expected to deliver the income required in order to pay members’ pensions, reducing the volatility of the financial position of the schemes. One of the key risks of this type of ‘buy and hold’ strategy is default risk: the risk that the credit instruments don’t deliver the expected income due to default. This risk is managed by investing primarily in investment grade credit instruments which are expected to have a lower risk of default as well as investing in a well diversified portfolio of assets",163
doc_title,heading860," —Reinvestment risk  – the ‘buy and hold’ strategy mentioned above generates excess asset income in the short term which would need to be reinvested in the future in order to continue meeting the expected benefits for members over the longer term. There is a risk that this income is reinvested at worse terms than assumed, which might mean that further contributions are required from the group in the future. The scenario where this may apply (narrowing credit spreads) is likely to be during a more buoyant economic environment which is likely to be beneficial for the group more generally",117
doc_title,heading861," —Mortality risk  – the assumptions adopted by the group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan and consequently increases in the liabilities. The group and Trustee of each plan review the mortality assumptions on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption",85
doc_title,heading862,Other mattersThe group expects to contribute approximately £4.5 million (which is made up entirely of payments from the ABF arrangement – see below) to its defined benefit pension plans in the next financial year,41
doc_title,heading863,"Effective from 29 September 2014, KPMG LLP entered into an ABF agreement with the pension plans through the establishment of a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP). Under this agreement, the beneficial interest in certain trade receivables to a fair value of £90 million was transferred to the SLP . The transfer was effected via a receivables purchase agreement, which sets out how £90 million of the group’s receivables will be transferred to the SLP for a 25-year period from the date of implementation.21 . Retirement benefits (continued)The plans have a limited interest in the SLP and are entitled to combined annual distribution from the profits of the SLP of £4.5 million (£3.9 million pre-2000 fund; £0.6 million TMcL plan) payable monthly for 25 years from the date of implementation. The payments to a plan will cease if it reaches a fully funded status determined using a low-risk measure of the plan’s liabilities",204
doc_title,heading864,"The SLP is controlled by the group and its results are consolidated by the group. The group’s statement of financial position, IAS 19 deficit and income statement are unchanged by the establishment of the SLP . The investment held by the plans in the SLP does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the group’s financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets. The value of the trade receivables transferred to the SLP remains on the group’s statement of financial position",109
doc_title,heading865,"As a result of the transactions under the ABF , the partnership’s statement of financial position, at the inception of the agreement, was changed to reflect its receivable from the SLP of £30 million, prepayment of contributions to the pension funds of £60 million and a liability of £90 million arising under the receivables purchase agreement. The IAS 19 deficit and income statement were unchanged",83
doc_title,heading866,"Because taxation in the partnership is a personal liability of the individual members, no deferred tax on the plans’ balances falls to be recorded in the financial statements of both the group and partnership",37
doc_title,heading867,The High Court ruled on 26 October 2018 in the landmark Lloyds Banking Group case on the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP). The judgement requires equalisation between men and women for the effect of unequal GMPs and the impact of this decision was accounted for at 30 September 2019,60
doc_title,heading868,"This does not affect the pre-2000 fund but does affect the TMcL plan, as this arrangement was contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The group included an allowance of 1 .2% of the TMcL plan’s defined benefit obligation for the impact of the GMP equalisation at 30 September 2019 and the estimated increase in liabilities was recognised as a past service cost within the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2019. The same approach has been taken to derive the TMcL plan defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2020. On 20 November 2020, the High Court handed down a further judgement confirming that defined benefit schemes which provide GMPs need to revisit and, where necessary, top up historical cash equivalent transfer values that were calculated based on unequalised benefits. We consider that this latest judgement creates an additional obligation for the TMcL plan from the date of the judgement",182

doc_title,heading872,A key component of the Trustees’ investment strategy for the TMcL plan and the pre-2000 fund is liability-driven investments (LDI). The values of these investments increase and decrease with movements in the liabilities of each arrangement,48

doc_title,heading940,"Accounting policy – policy applicable from 1 October 2019At the inception of a contract, the group and partnership assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group and partnership assess whether: —The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified; —The group and partnership have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and —The group and partnership have the right to direct the use of the asset. The group and partnership have this right as a result of the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases, where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the group and partnership have the right to direct the use of the asset if either: –The group and partnership have the right to operate the asset; or –The group and partnership designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used",297
doc_title,heading941,"This policy is applied to contracts entered into or changed after 1 October 2019.Contracts entered into before 1 October 2019For contracts entered into before 1 October 2019, the group and partnership determine whether the arrangement was or contained a lease based on the assessment of whether: —Fulfilment of the arrangement was dependent on the use of a specified asset or assets; and —The arrangement had conveyed a right to use the asset. An arrangement conveyed the right to use the asset if one of the following was met: –The group and partnership had the ability or right to operate the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output; –The group and partnership had the ability or right to control physical access to the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output; or –Facts and circumstances indicated that it was remote that other parties would take more than an insignificant amount of the output, and the price per unit was neither fixed per unit of output nor equal to the current market price per unit of the output",208
doc_title,heading942,"As a lesseeThe group and partnership recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and, if relevant, an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received",103
doc_title,heading943,"The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.

doc_title,heading945,"NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statementsThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group and partnership’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the group and partnership use its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate",77
doc_title,heading946,"Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:  —fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;  —variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;  —amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and  —the exercise price under a purchase option that the group and partnership are reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the group and partnership are reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group and partnership are reasonably certain not to terminate early",132
doc_title,heading947,"The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, there is a change in the group and partnership’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the group and partnership changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option",87
doc_title,heading948,"When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero",52

doc_title,heading957,"NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statementsJudgementWhen the group and partnership have the option to extend or terminate a lease, management uses its judgement to determine whether or not an option would be reasonably certain to be exercised.

doc_title,heading958,"The most significant impact of management’s assessment regarding the exercise of the extension or terminate options relates to office buildings. Where practicable, the group and partnership seek to include an extension or terminate option in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the group and partnership and not by the lessors. The group and partnership assess at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise either the extension or termination options. The group and partnership reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances during the life of the lease",124
doc_title,heading959,"During the year ended 30 September 2020, the group and partnership have reassessed the likely future use of property currently leased as a result of a number of factors including the restructuring of certain business areas, such as the closure of Makinson Cowell in the UK and the US and the exit of the pensions business. Taking into account these factors and the impact of COVID-19 more generally, management have determined that it is more likely that termination options will be invoked in certain properties and certain property assets have been impaired (see page 67), reflecting an expectation as to the exercise of termination options and future use of the property (see note 11). A different assessment as to the expectation around future use of these properties would result in a different net book value for the assets and lease liabilities recognised at 30 September 2020 by up to £48 million (see note 2).24. Leases (continued)Leases as a lesseeThe group and partnership lease a number of office facilities. The periods of the leases vary between 1-25 years; lease payments are generally subject to rent review every five years. The group also leases certain IT equipment, IT data storage facilities, office equipment and motor vehicles. These leases typically run for a period of four years. With the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability",286
doc_title,heading960,"The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but each lease imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the group and partnership to sublet the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the group and partnership. Leases are either non-cancellable or may be cancelled by exercising an earlier break date",75
doc_title,heading961,Some leases contain an option to extend the lease for a further term. The group and partnership are prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets as security,30
doc_title,heading962,"For leases over office buildings the group and partnership must keep those properties in a good state of repair and return the properties in their original condition at the end of the lease.

The arrangements are classified as joint ventures if the contracting parties’ rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities; the arrangements are classified as joint operations if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement. The group has accounted for its interest in its joint operations by recognising its share of individual assets, liabilities, revenue and costs",102
doc_title,heading983,"Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. JudgementAs set out below, certain investee entities are not 100% owned by the group. A judgement is required as to whether the group controls these investee entities despite non-standard ownership arrangements or whether a joint arrangement exists: —Queen Street Mutual (QSM): no ownership but power to control through power to appoint majority board members and right to entitlement to benefit from future profits or existing retained reserves; —Operations in India: the group and other shareholding partners are the recipients of substantially all the services provided by the entities and will be the only source of funding to settle the entities’ liabilities",207

The scope of the report includes KPMG’s operations in the UK excluding the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. We use electronic data collection processes to gather our data. Where data does not exist for a full 12 month reporting period we have estimated outstanding data by extrapolating known data. Our method for calculating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is based on the GHG Protocol standards and guidance documents",122
doc_title,heading995,"We use carbon conversion factors issued annually by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to report carbon emissions",25
doc_title,heading996,"Energy consumption and associated carbon emissions in this period has been materially affected by the impact of COVID-19, however we have continued to work proactively to reduce our energy consumption and our carbon emissions where possible. In November 2019, we achieved certification to ISO50001, the standard for Energy Management Systems (EnMS). The development of the system has enabled us to monitor and report energy consumption more effectively and identify areas for continual improvement. Our electricity consumption has reduced 20% against 2019 due to the reduced use of our office estate during the pandemic. However, our natural gas has remained broadly the same as the lockdown occurred during the warmer months",128
doc_title,heading997,"This year we also deployed remote collaboration technology across the firm. In the first half of the year this reduced the amount of business travel being conducted and in the second half of the year, in response to the pandemic, became the default method of business communication and interaction. We continue to purchase renewable energy for our managed estate, and this year collaborated with our landlords in our leased buildings on renewable energy purchasing. We’re pleased to report 85% of the electricity we consume is purchased with Guarantees of Origin from renewable sources.
