       " 'Report to the members\\nThe Board submits its report together with the audited consolidated financial statements of \\nKPMG LLP and its subsidiary undertakings (the group) for the year ended 30 September 2021 .\\nLegal structure\\nKPMG LLP is the UK member firm of the KPMG global \\norganisation of independent member firms affiliated with \\nKPMG International. Each member firm is a separate and \\nindependent legal entity and describes itself as such. \\nAll member firms are committed to following common \\nstandards in the provision of services for clients and to \\nmaintaining the highest levels of independence and integrity.\\nKPMG LLP is incorporated in the UK as a limited liability \\npartnership under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act \\n2000 and is referred to in these financial statements as ‘the \\npartnership’.\\nThe partnership’s registered office is 15 Canada Square, \\nCanary Wharf, London, E14 5GL.\\nPrincipal activities\\nThe principal activities of the group are the provision of \\nprofessional services, notably audit, tax and legal, deal \\nadvisory and consulting. The group operates primarily \\nthrough the partnership and its subsidiary undertakings, \\npredominantly in the UK but also has operations in other \\ncountries as client contracts require (see note 26).\\nGovernance\\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2021, the governance \\nstructure of the partnership comprised:\\n —The Board: the main governance body of the \\ngroup, responsible for overseeing the stewardship, \\naccountability and leadership of the group, providing \\nclear-sighted counsel on the strategic direction of the \\ngroup and alignment to its vision, values and purpose.\\n —The Executive Committee: responsible for driving the \\nboard-approved strategy for the group and leading on \\nissues that cut across the group.\\nBoth the Board and Executive Committee are supported \\nby various sub-committees; full details of the governance \\nstructures, including changes in year, as well as the \\ncomposition and responsibilities of the Board, Executive \\nCommittee and sub-committees can be found on the \\ngroup’s website and in the group’s separately published \\nTransparency Report.\\nDesignated members\\nThe designated members (as defined in the Limited Liability \\nPartnerships Act 2000) of the partnership during the year \\nwere:\\nJon Holt (appointed 21 July 2021)\\nJeremy Barton\\nTim Jones\\nBill Michael (resigned 28 February 2021)Members’ capital\\nThe group is financed through a combination of members’ \\ncapital, undistributed profits and borrowing facilities. \\nMembers’ capital is provided by each member on becoming \\na partner and is only repayable on retirement or resignation \\nso generally remains stable from year to year. However, \\nduring the year, partners voted in favour of allocating £201 \\nmillion of reserves to members’ capital, for repayment only \\nafter retirement, thereby retaining funds in the business for \\nfuture investment. As a result, members’ capital increased to \\n£258 million at 30 September 2021 (2020: £87 million). \\nMembers’ profit shares and drawings\\nDuring the year, members receive monthly drawings and, \\nfrom time to time, additional profit share distributions. The \\nlevel and timing of the additional distributions are decided by \\nthe Executive Committee and approved by the Board, taking \\ninto account the group’s cash requirements for operating and \\ninvesting activities.\\nThe remuneration model is designed to drive and reward \\nbehaviours consistent with our strategy and values, reflect \\nan individual’s medium-term value as well as current year \\nperformance against their goals. It also promotes clarity \\nand transparency amongst members regarding their own \\nremuneration and that of other members. A member’s \\nremuneration generally comprises two elements as \\ndescribed below based on target unit pay. The allocation of \\ntarget units is communicated to members in November each \\nyear and is determined in relation to an individual’s medium-\\nterm value to the group.\\nEach member’s unit allocation is determined with quality \\nas the primary factor and with other factors such as past \\nperformance, market value of skill set, individual capability, \\nleadership qualities and overall contribution to the group \\ntaken into account.\\nThe profit allocated to members is distributed as follows:\\nBase Unit Pay – each member will receive 75% of their \\ntarget units;\\nBonus Unit Pay – each member will receive a multiplier of \\ntheir remaining 25% bonus units based on their relative in-\\nyear performance against their performance metrics.\\nThese elements account for the majority of the total profit \\nallocated to members. The remainder was allocated to those \\nmembers who retired in the year, and who received an \\nadditional profit share in line with the KPMG LLP partnership \\nagreement. A deduction is made from the total pay for any \\nmembers if their behaviour, quality or performance has fallen \\nbelow the levels expected by the Executive Committee and \\nBoard, as indicated by adverse Quality and Risk metrics.\\n3\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

       " 'Financial performance during the year\\nRevenue grew by 6% year on year, to £2,433 million (2020: \\n£2,303 million); on a like for like basis, excluding revenue \\nof the restructuring and pensions businesses, net sales \\nincreased by 12% to £2,039 million (2020: £1,826 million). \\nAll four of our capabilities delivered strong growth, with \\ngrowth in net sales of 5% in Audit, 8% in Tax & Legal, \\n13%\\xa0in Consulting and 31% in Deal Advisory, the latter \\nbenefitting from an increase in M&A activity and other \\ndiscretionary spend projects. \\nWe continued to focus on operating in a lean and agile way \\nas we adapted to remote and hybrid working. This focus \\nresulted in a 29% growth in capability contribution, with \\ngrowth across all four capabilities, and a 48% growth in \\nprofit for the financial year, excluding the profit on disposal of \\nbusinesses in each year.\\nSee note 3 for reconciliation between internal measures of \\ncapability performance – net sales and contribution – and \\nrevenue and profit for the financial year. \\nFinancial position at the end of the year\\nThe financial position of the group and partnership has \\nstrengthened considerably during the year. As set out on \\npage 3, operations are generally financed by members’ \\ncapital and other members’ interests, which together \\ntotalled £697 million at 30 September 2021 (2020: £357 \\nmillion) for the group and £595 million (2020: £277 million) \\nfor the partnership. Total members’ interests increased as \\na result of improved profitability and the retention of profits \\narising on the disposal of the restructuring business.\\nWhilst bank facilities of £475 million were available to the \\ngroup at 30 September 2021, the group and partnership \\nheld £465 million (2020: £139 million) and £428 million \\n(2020: £101 million) of cash balances respectively and had no \\nborrowings at the year end.\\nThe main current assets of the group are trade receivables \\nand contract assets, both of which are monitored across the \\nbusiness. The prompt rendering of fees for work done and \\ncollection of the resulting receivables are important aspects \\nof the monitoring of financial risks within the group. These \\nassets totalled £833 million (2020: £740 million) for the group \\nand £801 million (2020: £704 million) for the partnership.\\nGoing concern\\nAs set out on page 3, the group has access to considerable \\nfinancial resources, namely members’ capital, undistributed \\nprofits and borrowing facilities. This funding, together \\nwith well-established relationships with many clients and \\nsuppliers across different geographic areas and industries, \\nleaves the group well placed to manage the financial impact \\nof our business risks, including those that have arisen as a \\nresult of COVID-19 and may arise as a result of other wider \\neconomic impacts. The resilience measures taken by the group early in the pandemic, including cost containment and \\nenhanced focus on working capital management, together \\nwith further measures taken to strengthen our capital \\nstructure in 2021, have improved the group’s resilience both \\nin the immediate and longer term.\\nForecasts have been prepared for the group, for the purpose \\nof assessing going concern through to 30 September \\n2023, reflecting the group’s business plan. These forecasts \\nreflect a range of downside scenarios and a Plausible but \\nSevere scenario that incorporates a number of impacts, \\nincluding those arising from a further deterioration of the \\neconomy, prolonged impact from COVID-19, regulatory \\nand reputational matters. Whilst the Plausible but Severe \\nscenario reflects a significantly reduced level of trading and \\nrevenue growth available to the group, it demonstrates that \\nthe group can withstand periods of reduced profitability, \\noperating within borrowing facilities and covenants \\nthroughout the forecast period without reliance on cost \\nmitigating or liquidity enhancing measures. Should the \\nmatters considered as part of the Plausible but Severe \\nscenario significantly worsen, management has the option \\nof reintroducing certain of the measures taken at the outset \\nof the pandemic such as postponing investment spend or \\ndeferring payments to partners.\\nAt 30 September 2021, the group had cash balances of \\n£465\\xa0million (2020: £139 million) and undrawn facilities of \\n£475 million (2020: £475 million) including an additional \\nrevolving credit facility of £90 million (2020: £90 million) \\nagreed in April 2020 and expiring in October 2021 . This level \\nof cash and committed, undrawn funding provides strong \\nfinancial resilience through continued disruption caused \\nby any economic factors and allows the group to actively \\npursue, respond to and invest in opportunities in line with \\nthe group’s business plan. Full details of the borrowing \\nfacilities are set out in note 16. Subsequent to the year end, \\nthe group has entered into new borrowing facilities as set \\nout in note 27; as a result, unsecured borrowing facilities \\ntotalling £385 million are available to the group for five years. \\nThe group’s objectives, policies and processes to address \\nrisks arising from the group’s use of financial instruments, in \\nparticular its exposure to market, credit and liquidity risks are \\nset out in note 22.\\nHaving considered the group’s forecasts and the wider \\nbusiness risks faced by the group, (as set out in the group’s \\nseparately published Transparency Report) including known \\nevents and conditions that may arise beyond the forecast \\nperiod, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the \\ngroup has adequate resources to continue in operational \\nexistence for the going concern assessment period. \\nAccordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern \\nbasis in preparing this report and financial statements.Report to the members\\n(continued)\\n4\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

The \\nfinancial statements are presented in millions of pounds \\n(£m) unless stated otherwise.\\nGoing Concern\\nAs set out in the Report to the members, the group \\nhas access to considerable financial resources, namely \\nmembers’ capital, undistributed profits and borrowings. This \\nfunding, together with well-established relationships with \\nmany clients and suppliers across different geographic areas \\nand industries, leaves the group well placed to manage the \\nfinancial impact of our business risks, including those that \\nhave arisen as a result of COVID-19 and may arise as a result \\nof other wider economic impacts. The resilience measures \\ntaken by the group early in the pandemic, including cost \\ncontainment and enhanced focus on working capital \\nmanagement, together with further measures taken to \\nstrengthen our capital structure in 2021, have improved the \\ngroup’s resilience both in the immediate and longer term.\\nForecasts have been prepared for the group, for the purpose \\nof assessing going concern through to 30 September \\n2023, reflecting the group’s business plan. These forecasts \\nreflect a range of downside scenarios and a Plausible but \\nSevere scenario that incorporates a number of impacts, \\nincluding those arising from a further deterioration of the \\neconomy, prolonged impact from COVID-19, regulatory \\nand reputational matters. Whilst the Plausible but Severe \\nscenario reflects a significantly reduced level of trading and \\nrevenue growth available to the group, it demonstrates that \\nthe group can withstand periods of reduced profitability, \\noperating within borrowing facilities and covenants \\nthroughout the forecast period without reliance on cost \\nmitigating or liquidity enhancing measures. Should the \\nmatters considered as part of the Plausible but Severe \\nscenario significantly worsen, management has the option \\nof reintroducing certain of the measures taken at the outset \\nof the pandemic such as postponing investment spend or \\ndeferring payments to partners.\\nAt 30 September 2021, the group had cash balances of \\n£465\\xa0million (2020: £139 million) and undrawn facilities of \\n£475 million (2020: £475 million) including an additional \\nrevolving credit facility of £90 million (2020: £90 million) \\nagreed in April 2020 and expiring in October 2021; this level \\nof cash and committed, undrawn funding provides strong \\nfinancial resilience through continued disruption caused \\nby any economic factors and allows the group to actively \\npursue, respond to and invest in opportunities in line with \\nthe group’s business plan. Full details of the borrowing \\nfacilities are set out in note 16. Subsequent to the year end, the group has entered into \\nnew borrowing facilities as set out in note 27; as a result, \\nunsecured borrowing facilities totalling £385 million are \\navailable to the group for five years. \\nThe group’s objectives, policies and processes to address \\nrisks arising from the group’s use of financial instruments, in \\nparticular its exposure to market, credit and liquidity risks are \\nset out in note 22.\\nHaving considered the group’s forecasts and the wider \\nbusiness risks faced by the group, (as set out in the group’s \\nseparately published Transparency Report) including known \\nevents and conditions that may arise beyond the forecast \\nperiod, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the \\ngroup has adequate resources to continue in operational \\nexistence for the going concern assessment period. \\nAccordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern \\nbasis in preparing this report and financial statements.\\nForeign currency\\nTransactions in each entity in foreign currencies other \\nthan its functional currency are recorded at the foreign \\nexchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary \\nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies \\nat the year-end date are retranslated in each entity at the \\nforeign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange \\ndifferences arising on translation are recognised in the \\nincome statement within financial income or expense, as \\nappropriate. Non-monetary assets that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in foreign currency are translated \\nusing the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\\nFor presentation purposes, the revenues and expenses of \\ngroup undertakings with a functional currency other than \\npounds sterling are translated at an average rate for the \\nperiod where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange \\nrates ruling at the dates of the transactions. The assets and \\nliabilities of such undertakings, including goodwill and fair \\nvalue adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated \\nat foreign exchange rates ruling at year-end. Exchange \\ndifferences arising from this retranslation are recognised in \\nother comprehensive income in the translation reserve.1 .

If any such indication exists, then \\nthe asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill \\nthe recoverable amount is estimated each year at the \\nsame\\xa0time.\\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its \\nvalue in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing \\nvalue in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted \\nto their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that \\nreflects current market assessments of the time value of \\nmoney and the risks specific to the asset.\\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot \\nbe tested individually are grouped together into the smallest \\ngroup of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing \\nuse that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other \\nassets or groups of assets (the cash-generating unit (or \\nCGU)). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for \\nthe purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs.\\nSubject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the \\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which \\ngoodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level \\nat which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at \\nwhich goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. \\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated \\nto groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the \\nsynergies of the combination.An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount \\nof an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable \\namount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income \\nstatement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of \\nCGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of \\nany goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the \\ncarrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of \\nunits) on a pro rata basis.\\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. \\nIn respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised \\nin prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any \\nindications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. \\nAn impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in \\nthe estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. \\nAn impairment loss is reversed only to the extent \\nthat the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the \\ncarrying amount that would have been determined, net \\nof depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had \\nbeen\\xa0recognised.1 .

       " 'Notes\\nForming part of the consolidated financial statements3. Revenue \\nAll revenue of the group and partnership is generated from \\ncontracts with customers.\\nAccounting policy \\nRevenue is recognised when, or as, the group and \\npartnership satisfy performance obligations, contained in \\ncontracts with clients, by transferring control of services \\nto clients. Revenue is measured as the fair value of \\nconsideration received or receivable for satisfying those \\nperformance obligations, including recoverable expenses but \\nexcluding value added tax.\\nRecoverable expenses represent charges from other KPMG \\nInternational member firms, sub-contractors and out-of-\\npocket expenses incurred in respect of assignments and \\nexpected to be recovered from clients.\\nRevenue is recognised at an amount that depicts the \\ntransaction price of the transfer of professional services to a \\ncustomer. Variable consideration, such as fee arrangements \\ncontingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future \\nevent, is included in the transaction price only to the extent \\nthat it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not \\nbe required when the uncertainties determining the level of \\nvariable consideration are subsequently resolved. \\nThe majority of the group’s revenue is derived from contracts \\nwhere the consideration is based on time and materials. For \\nthese contracts the group satisfies performance obligations \\nover time and revenue is recognised as services are \\nprovided at the rate agreed with the client, provided there is \\nan enforceable right to payment for performance completed \\nto date.\\nSimilarly, revenue derived from fixed fee contracts is \\nrecognised over time based on the actual service provided to \\nthe end of the reporting period relative to total services to be \\nprovided, generally assessed by reference to actual inputs \\nof time and expenses as a proportion of the total expected \\ninputs, where there is an enforceable right to payment for \\nperformance completed to date. \\nFor contingent fee contracts, including certain Deal Advisory \\nengagements where the group are providing deal support, \\nconsideration is constrained in estimating revenue and \\nrecognised at a point in time when the contingency is \\nresolved and the firm has an entitlement to payment. \\nWhere contracts include multiple performance obligations, \\nthe transaction price is allocated to each performance \\nobligation based on its stand-alone selling price, reflecting \\nexpected cost-plus margin if a stand-alone selling price is not \\ndirectly observable.\\nInvoices are issued in accordance with the terms of \\nengagement; except where consideration is variable, fees \\nare usually billed on account based on a payment schedule \\nand standard payment terms are usually 30 days from date \\nof issue. Where revenue recognised by the group and partnership \\nexceeds the amounts invoiced, a ‘Contract asset’ \\nis recognised within ‘Trade and other receivables’. \\nConsideration received or amounts due in excess of revenue \\nrecognised by the group and partnership are classified \\nas ‘Contract liabilities’ within ‘Trade and other payables’. \\nContract assets are reclassified as trade receivables when \\ninvoiced or when the consideration becomes unconditional \\nbecause only the passage of time is required before \\npayment is due. \\nSignificant estimate\\nIn calculating revenue from service contracts, the group \\nand partnership make certain estimates as to the extent \\nto which performance obligations have been satisfied. In \\ndoing so, the group and partnership estimate the remaining \\ntime and external costs to be incurred in completing \\ncontracts and the clients’ willingness and ability to pay for \\nthe services provided. These estimates depend upon the \\noutcome of future events and may need to be revised as \\ncircumstances\\xa0change.\\nCertain service contracts, notably those in Deal Advisory, \\nConsulting and Tax & Legal, require a greater degree of \\nestimation than others, specifically those contracts that:\\n —are long-term, spanning a number of accounting periods, \\nthereby extending the period over which estimation \\nis\\xa0required;\\n —have fee arrangements other than a simple time and \\nmaterials basis, requiring an estimation as to percentage \\ncompletion over time; \\n —have multiple deliverables, such as software \\nimplementation and support services, requiring an \\nestimate as to revenue allocation to each deliverable \\nor percentage completion over time if the contract is \\nconsidered to be a single performance obligation.\\nEstimates of revenue, costs or extent of progress toward \\ncompletion are revised if circumstances change. Estimates \\nare updated at each reporting date, including application of \\nany constraint in respect of variable consideration until the \\nuncertainty is resolved. Any resulting increases or decreases \\nin estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the income \\nstatement in the period in which the circumstances arose. \\nA different assessment of these estimates may impact \\nthe carrying value of contract assets recognised of £339 \\nmillion (2020: £329 million) for the group and £331 million \\n(2020: £313 million) for the partnership at 30 September \\n2021 . A 5% movement in contract assets would result in a \\nchange in revenue of £17 million for group and £16 million for \\npartnership.\\n26\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Any proposal of the Board to retain more than 25% (2020: 10%) of the adjusted \\ngroup profits for the period is subject to a member vote.

The \\nexpenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct \\nlabour and an appropriate proportion of overheads directly \\nattributable to developing the intangible.

The estimated useful life of internally generated \\nsoftware is generally four to eight years. \\nGoodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment \\nlosses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units \\n(CGUs), where the CGU reflects the level at which the \\nindividual acquired business is now managed and is not \\namortised but is tested annually for impairment. \\nCustomer relationships and similar assets are stated at cost \\nless accumulated amortisation and impairment.

For \\nthe purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated \\nto the CGU that is expected to benefit from the business \\ncombination in which the goodwill arose. The recoverable \\namount of a CGU is calculated with reference to the higher \\nof its value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. In \\nassessing value in use, the group applies a growth rate \\nto the relevant CGU, as set out on page 40. These growth \\nrates are dependent on future events and may need to be \\nrevised as circumstances change. A different assessment \\nof the growth rate in each case may result in a different \\nassessment of impairment arising. \\nWe have performed sensitivity analysis around the \\nassumptions used for value in use calculations. An \\nimpairment of £1 million has been recognised in respect \\nof KPMG CIO Advisory Limited and we consider it unlikely \\nthat there would be reasonably possible changes in the \\nkey assumptions set out on page 40 that would cause the \\ncarrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount for any \\nother individual goodwill asset.

       " 'Notes\\nForming part of the consolidated financial statementsThe acquired businesses listed on page 39 all form part of the group’s Consulting capability; the Consulting business is \\nmanaged and performance monitored across a number of CGUs. Goodwill has been allocated to individual CGUs reflecting \\neither an individual acquired business (KPMG Boxwood and Microsoft Business Solutions) or as part of a larger business \\nunit if the acquired business is no longer reviewed on a stand-alone basis (‘Connected Customer’ for KPMG Nunwood \\nand ‘People and Change’ for the HRSD Practice of Towers Watson). The recoverable amount of the CGU is calculated with \\nreference to the higher of its value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. In the case of value in use, forecasts of the \\nrelevant CGU are based on current levels of activity and known plans for that particular part of the business, assuming a \\n2% growth in contribution year on year for the next five years and 0% thereafter. The discount rate applied for the year \\nended 30 September 2021 was 9.2% (2020: 9.2% - 12.3%). The growth rates used in the value in use calculation reflect \\na conservative view given the past performance of these CGUs and uncertainties around further market growth in these \\ncapabilities beyond the initial forecast period. \\nFor Microsoft Business Solutions, the recoverable amount of the CGU is calculated with reference to its fair value less costs \\nof disposal. The fair value (assessed as a measurement level 2) reflects the enterprise value calculated for the purpose of \\nthe group’s acquisition of the minority interest from KPMG Netherlands and KPMG Malta, which completed following the \\ndisposal of KPMG Crimsonwing BV in November 2021 .\\nWhere the calculated recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value, no impairment arises. A reasonable change in \\nthe key assumptions does not have a significant impact on the difference between value in use and carrying value where \\nvalue in use has been used as the basis for recoverable amount.

       " 'Notes\\nForming part of the consolidated financial statementsPartnership \\nUnder the ABF arrangement (see note 20), the partnership prepaid £60 million into the defined benefit plans, £52 million in \\nthe pre-2000 fund and £8 million in the TMcL fund, at the inception of the agreement. Under the agreement the SLP , a group \\nentity set up on inception of the agreement, makes monthly payments totalling £4.5 million per annum to the pension plans \\nfor 25 years from the date of implementation. The prepayment of £60 million is therefore expected to reduce to £nil over the \\nperiod of 25 years with the discount unwinding through financial income. \\nAt 30 September 2021, the prepayment was £50 million (2020: £51 million); £46 million (2020: £47 million) is non-current, \\nwhilst the remaining £4 million (2020: £4 million) is current, classified as other prepayments within trade and other \\nreceivables. \\nIn addition, at the inception of the ABF , the partnership contributed £30 million to the SLP which it expects to recover on \\nfuture termination of the ABF . It is expected that the pension deficits would reduce over the period and therefore the ABF \\nwould generate a return of £60 million to the partnership at the end of the 25 year life. At 30 September 2021, a receivable \\nbalance of £41 million is classified as amounts due from other UK undertakings within other non-current assets with the \\ndiscount unwinding through financial income (2020: £39 million). \\nAlso under the ABF , the partnership has transferred £90 million of its trade receivables to the SLP (see note 20). As the \\npartnership retains the risks and rewards of those receivables it has a corresponding liability, reflecting the amount owed \\nto the SLP under this agreement. A financial expense of £4.5 million has been recognised in the partnership’s income \\nstatement in respect of the unwinding discount on this liability.13. Other non-current assets and liabilities (continued)\\n14. T rade and other receivables\\nAccounting policy \\nTrade and other receivables (except contract assets) are initially recognised at their transaction price as defined by IFRS \\n15. Subsequent to initial recognition, trade and other receivables are recorded at amortised cost less expected credit \\nlosses\\xa0(ECLs). \\nContract assets represents revenues recognised in satisfying performance obligations where consideration is conditional on \\nsomething other than the passage of time. Contract assets are recognised at their transaction price as defined by IFRS 15 (in \\naccordance with the revenue accounting policy set out in note 3) less provision for foreseeable losses and net of amounts \\nbilled on account.\\nSignificant Estimate\\nIn calculating the loss allowance for ECLs on trade receivables and contract assets, the group and partnership have made \\ncertain assumptions as to the probability of default of specific clients and clients within certain industries, assessed \\nby reference to data published by external credit rating agencies. At 30 September 2021, the ECL was assessed to be \\n£6 million for the group (2020: £19 million) and £6 million for the partnership (2020: £18 million). However, a different \\nassessment of the probability of default in respect of these clients and industries would result in a different level of ECL; an \\nincrease in the weighted average loss rate by 1% would result in recognition of a further £7 million of ECL for both group \\nand partnership. Accordingly, this is no longer considered to be a significant estimate (see note 2). \\nImpairment \\nThe group and partnership recognise loss allowances for ECLs on financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract \\nassets (as defined in IFRS 15). The loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime\\xa0ECLs.\\nWhen estimating ECL, the group and partnership consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and \\navailable without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the \\npartnership’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.\\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\\n42\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Property \\nprovisions are recognised for dilapidation costs anticipated \\non exiting properties leased by the group and partnership. \\nPartner annuities\\nThe partnership has conditional commitments to pay \\nannuities to certain former members (and dependants). \\nThese annuities are payable only out of profits of the \\npartnership, on which they constitute a first charge. The \\npresent value of the best estimate of the expected liabilities \\nfor future payments to retired members or their dependants \\nis provided in full, gross of attributable taxation that is \\ndeducted by KPMG from payments to annuitants, as a \\ncharge against income at the point at which the contractual \\nright arises. \\nAny changes in the provision for former members’ \\nannuities arising from changes in former members and \\ntheir dependants or in financial estimates and actuarial \\nassumptions are recognised in the income statement. \\nThe payment of former members’ annuities is shown as a \\nmovement against the provision. \\nJudgement\\nIn addition to former partner annuities, the Operating \\nProvisions of the partnership allow for one-off member \\nretirement payments to current retiring partners in certain \\ncircumstances, subject to prior approval by the Executive \\nCommittee. Management have assessed that no provision \\nis required for future member retirement payments as these \\npayments reflect an additional profit share and as such there \\nis no additional outflow of resources required to settle the \\nobligation. A different judgement taken in this respect would \\nresult in recognition of a liability classified as Amounts due to members; a high-level actuarial exercise estimates that such \\na provision could be around £66 million at 30 September \\n2021 (2020: £60 million).\\nProfessional claims and regulatory matters\\nThe group from time to time receives claims in respect \\nof professional service matters and may be subject to \\ndisciplinary proceedings brought by regulatory authorities. \\nIt defends such claims where appropriate but where an \\noutflow of resources is considered probable and reliable \\nestimates can be made, a provision is made for the best \\nestimate of probable cost (including related legal costs) \\nof settling professional service claims brought against \\nthe partnership and group by third parties and disciplinary \\nproceedings brought by regulatory authorities. \\nThe group maintains professional indemnity insurance, \\nprincipally written through mutual insurance companies. \\nPremiums are expensed as they fall due with prepayments \\nor accruals being recognised accordingly. Reimbursement \\nunder insurance contracts is recognised when the recovery \\nbecomes virtually certain. \\nJudgement\\nManagement have determined whether a provision, \\ncontingent liability or neither arises at the balance sheet date \\nin respect of each individual matter and whether disclosure \\nof the relevant matter would be seriously prejudicial to \\nthe position of the group. These judgements are taken by \\nmanagement based on all the specific circumstances in each \\ncase, taking account of all available evidence including the \\nopinion of experts where relevant.\\nThese professional service claims and regulatory matters, \\nor indeed pre-action claims in some cases, are at various \\nstages in lengthy and complex processes that have a variety \\nof possible outcomes. The Official Receiver for Carillion is \\nin the process of pursuing a claim against KPMG. This is \\nin early stages and KPMG will appropriately defend any \\nclaim\\xa0received. \\nThe likely outcome in any professional service claim or \\nregulatory matter can be difficult to predict based on \\nthe evidence available, resulting in a significant level of \\nuncertainty inherent in any assessment as to whether a \\nprovision exists at the year end. These uncertainties also \\nmean that it is not always possible to give a reliable estimate \\nof contingent liabilities arising from such professional service \\nclaims and regulatory matters. \\nNo separate disclosure is made of the detail of such claims, \\nregulatory matters and proceedings, the methodology \\nused to measure the amount that has been provided, the \\nuncertainties relating to the range of possible outcomes \\nconsidered or the costs recoverable by insurance, because, \\nin management’s view, to do so could seriously prejudice the \\nposition of both the group and partnership.\\n47\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Both plans are closed to future accrual of benefits. The group’s net obligations in respect of its defined \\nbenefit plans are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the benefits that former employees have earned in return \\nfor their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of plan assets (at \\nbid price) is deducted.\\nThe group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability for the period based on a spot rate approach. Under \\nthis approach the full yield curve which has been used to derive the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit \\nobligation is applied to the expected cash flows from the pension schemes in each year. This gives an average rate of interest \\nwhich is applied to the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the annual period adjusted for contributions and benefit \\npayments during the period.\\nThe discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation is based on a yield curve which has been derived based \\non information regarding AA-rated corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. The group determines a single equivalent \\ndiscount rate based on this yield curve being applied to sample pension scheme cash flows that broadly match the profile of \\nthe group’s pension schemes. The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. \\nWhen the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit related to past \\nservice by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the income statement when the plan \\namendment or curtailment occurs.\\n50\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

       " 'Notes\\nForming part of the consolidated financial statementsRisks\\nThe pension plans expose the group to several key risks, the \\nmost significant of which are detailed below:\\nDefault risk  – the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan have a \\nfully credit-based investment strategy based on buying and \\nholding credit instruments which are expected to deliver \\nthe income required in order to pay members’ pensions, \\nreducing the volatility of the financial position of the \\nschemes. One of the key risks of this type of ‘buy and hold’ \\nstrategy is default risk: the risk that the credit instruments \\ndon’t deliver the expected income due to default. This risk is \\nmanaged by investing primarily in investment grade credit \\ninstruments which are expected to have a lower risk of \\ndefault as well as investing in a well diversified portfolio of \\nassets.\\nReinvestment risk  – the ‘buy and hold’ strategy mentioned \\nabove generates excess asset income in the short-term \\nwhich would need to be reinvested in the future in order to \\ncontinue meeting the expected benefits for members over \\nthe longer term. There is a risk that this income is reinvested \\nat worse terms than assumed, which might mean that \\nfurther contributions are required from the group in the \\nfuture. The scenario where this may apply (narrowing credit \\nspreads) is likely to be during a more buoyant economic \\nenvironment which is likely to be beneficial for the group \\nmore generally.\\nMortality risk  – the assumptions adopted by the group \\nmake allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. \\nHowever, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than \\nassumed, this would result in greater payments from \\nthe pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan and consequently \\nincreases in the liabilities. The group and Trustee of each \\nplan review the mortality assumptions on a regular basis \\nto minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption. \\nThe group has updated their mortality assumption as at 30 \\nSeptember 2021 to reflect the latest available data from the \\nCMI, however, no explicit change has been made for the \\npotential effects of COVID-19 as there remains uncertainty \\naround the impact the pandemic will have on long term \\nmortality rates for the pension plan members.\\nOther matters\\nThe group expects to contribute approximately £4.5 million \\n(which is made up entirely of payments from the ABF \\narrangement – see below) to its defined benefit pension \\nplans in the next financial year.\\nEffective from 29 September 2014, KPMG LLP entered \\ninto an ABF agreement with the pension plans through \\nthe establishment of a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP). \\nUnder this agreement, the beneficial interest in certain trade \\nreceivables to a fair value of £90 million was transferred to \\nthe SLP . The transfer was effected via a receivables purchase 20. Retirement benefits (continued)\\nagreement, which sets out how £90 million of the group’s \\nreceivables will be transferred to the SLP for a 25-year period \\nfrom the date of implementation.\\nThe plans have a limited interest in the SLP and are entitled \\nto combined annual distribution from the profits of the SLP \\nof £4.5 million (£3.9 million pre-2000 fund; £0.6 million \\nTMcL plan) payable monthly for 25 years from the date \\nof implementation. The payments to a plan will cease if it \\nreaches a fully funded status determined using a low-risk \\nmeasure of the plan’s liabilities.\\nThe SLP is controlled by the group and its results are \\nconsolidated by the group. The group’s statement of financial \\nposition, IAS 19 deficit and income statement are unchanged \\nby the establishment of the SLP . The investment held by \\nthe plans in the SLP does not qualify as a plan asset for the \\npurposes of the group’s financial statements and is therefore \\nnot included within the fair value of plan assets. The value of \\nthe trade receivables transferred to the SLP remains on the \\ngroup’s statement of financial position. \\nAs a result of the transactions under the ABF , the \\npartnership’s statement of financial position, at the inception \\nof the agreement, was changed to reflect its receivable from \\nthe SLP of £30 million, prepayment of contributions to the \\npension funds of £60 million and a liability of £90 million \\narising under the receivables purchase agreement. The IAS \\n19 deficit and income statement were unchanged.\\nBecause taxation in the partnership is a personal liability \\nof the individual members, no deferred tax on the plans’ \\nbalances falls to be recorded in the financial statements of \\nboth the group and partnership.\\nThe High Court ruled on 26 October 2018 in the landmark \\nLloyds Banking Group case on the equalisation of \\nGuaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs). The judgement \\nrequires equalisation between men and women for the \\neffect of unequal GMPs and the impact of this decision was \\naccounted for in the disclosures. This did not affect the pre-\\n2000 fund but affects the TMcL plan, as this arrangement \\nwas contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension \\nScheme. On 20 November 2020, the High Court handed \\ndown a further judgment confirming that defined benefit \\nschemes which provide GMPs need to revisit and, where \\nnecessary, top-up historical Cash Equivalent Transfer Values \\nthat were calculated based on unequalised benefits. The \\ngroup has allowed for this additional liability of £0.2m as a \\npast service cost recognised in the income statement in the \\ncurrent year.\\n53\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

In addition, the right-of-use asset \\nis periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and \\nadjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. \\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of \\nthe lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \\ndate, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease \\nor, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group and \\npartnership’s incremental borrowing rate. \\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease \\nliability comprise the following: \\n —fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; \\n —variable lease payments that depend on an index or a \\nrate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the \\ncommencement date; \\n —the exercise price under a purchase option that the \\ngroup and partnership are reasonably certain to \\nexercise; \\n —lease payments in an optional renewal period if the \\ngroup and partnership are reasonably certain to exercise \\nan extension option; and \\n —penalties for early termination of a lease unless the \\ngroup and partnership are reasonably certain not to \\nterminate early.The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. It is remeasured if the group \\nand partnership changes its assessment of whether it will \\nexercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a \\ncorresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount \\nof the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the \\ncarrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced \\nto zero.\\nThe group presents right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and \\nequipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘non-current liabilities’ and \\n‘current liabilities’ in the statement of financial position.\\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets \\nThe group and partnership have elected not to recognise \\nright-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease of low-value \\nassets and short-term leases. The group and partnership \\nrecognise the lease payments associated with these leases \\nas an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nAs a lessor\\nAs an intermediate lessor, the group and partnership \\naccounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease \\nseparately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease \\nwith reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the \\nhead lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If \\na head lease is a short-term lease to which the group and \\npartnership applied the exemption described above, then it \\nclassifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\\nThe group and partnership recognise lease payments \\nreceived under operating leases as income on a straight-line \\nbasis over the lease term as part of ‘other income’.\\n66\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

       " 'Notes\\nForming part of the consolidated financial statementsJudgement\\nWhen the group and partnership have the option to extend \\nor terminate a lease, management uses its judgement to \\ndetermine whether or not an option would be reasonably \\ncertain to be exercised. Management considers all facts \\nand circumstances including their past practice and any \\ncost that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to \\nextend or terminate is not taken, to help them determine the \\nlease\\xa0term. \\nThe most significant impact of management’s assessment \\nregarding the exercise of the extension or terminate options \\nrelates to office buildings. Where practicable, the group \\nand partnership seek to include an extension or terminate \\noption in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The \\nextension and termination options held are exercisable only \\nby the group and partnership and not by the lessors. The \\ngroup and partnership assess at lease commencement \\nwhether it is reasonably certain to exercise either the \\nextension or termination options. The group and partnership \\nreassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the \\noptions if there is a significant event or significant change in \\ncircumstances during the life of the lease. \\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2021, the group and \\npartnership have reassessed the likely future use of property \\ncurrently leased as a result of a number of factors including \\nthe exit of the restructuring business and moves to hybrid \\nworking. Taking into account these factors management \\nhave determined that it is more likely that termination \\noptions will be invoked in certain properties and certain \\nproperty assets have been impaired (see page 68), reflecting \\na commitment as to the exercise of termination options \\nand future use of the property. A different assessment as \\nto the exit of these properties would result in a different net \\nbook value for the assets and lease liabilities recognised at \\n30\\xa0September 2021 .23. Leases (continued)\\nLeases as a lessee\\nThe group and partnership lease a number of office facilities. \\nThe periods of the leases vary between 1-25 years; lease \\npayments are generally subject to rent review every five \\nyears. The group also leases certain IT equipment, IT data \\nstorage facilities, office equipment and motor vehicles. \\nThese leases typically run for a period of four years. With \\nthe exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value \\nassets, each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a \\nright-of-use asset and a lease liability. \\nThe lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but \\neach lease imposes a restriction that, unless there is a \\ncontractual right for the group and partnership to sublet \\nthe asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only \\nbe used by the group and partnership. Leases are either \\nnon-cancellable or may be cancelled by exercising an earlier \\nbreak date.\\nSome leases contain an option to extend the lease for a \\nfurther term. The group and partnership are prohibited from \\nselling or pledging the underlying leased assets as security. \\nFor leases over office buildings the group and partnership \\nmust keep those properties in a good state of repair and \\nreturn the properties in their original condition at the end \\nof the lease. Further, the group and partnership must \\ninsure items of property, plant and equipment and incur \\nmaintenance fees on such items in accordance with the \\nlease contracts. \\nThe group and partnership sub-lease certain properties \\nunder operating leases.\\n67\\nUK Members’ Report and Financial Statements 2021\\n© 2022 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \\nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

We use \\nelectronic data collection processes to gather our data. \\nWhere data does not exist for a full 12-month reporting \\nperiod we have estimated outstanding data by extrapolating \\nknown data. Our method for calculating Greenhouse Gas \\n(GHG) emissions is based on the GHG Protocol standards \\nand guidance documents. We use carbon conversion factors \\nissued annually by the Department for Business, Energy & \\nIndustrial Strategy (BEIS) to report carbon emissions. \\nEnergy consumption and associated carbon emissions in \\nthis period has been materially affected by the impact of \\nCOVID-19, however we have continued to work proactively \\nto reduce our energy consumption and our carbon emissions \\nwhere possible. In September 2021 we received re-\\ncertification to the ISO14001, the standard for Environmental \\nManagement Systems (EMS). Alongside our certification to \\nISO50001, the standard for Energy Management Systems, \\nwe are able to monitor and report energy consumption \\nand total environmental impact more effectively, as well as \\nidentify areas for continual improvement. \\nDespite the challenge of the pandemic emissions reduction \\nactivities have been implemented across our offices \\nincluding a Building Management System upgrade in our \\nLeeds office, LED implementation in our Canary Wharf Head \\nOffice and upgrades to our Air Handling Units. Our engineers \\nalso benefit from an auto approval mechanism for projects \\nwith a three-year payback, this allows them to capitalise on \\nopportunities across the estate. \\nThis year the business continued to deploy a predominantly \\nremote-working model, necessitated by the global \\npandemic. From September 2021 onwards, the business \\nentered a ‘Reconnection Phase’, introducing hybrid-working \\nto the firm with employees able to attend KPMG offices \\nfour days a fortnight. Use of collaboration technology has \\ncontinued in earnest, with a 99% uptake across the firm \\nin Microsoft Teams. This is now established as the default \\nmethod of business communication and interaction, with \\nthis intended to remain the case for a period of time as \\nsociety continues to live with the global pandemic. This \\nhas seen a significant shift in mindset and behaviours, \\nwith business travel reducing considerably as a result of \\nthe\\xa0pandemic. In the reporting period, we have seen trends of significant \\nreduction in our electricity and gas consumption, as well as \\nin the production of waste in our different waste streams. \\nThis is as a result of low occupation of KPMG offices due to \\ngovernment and business requirements to stay at home and \\nwork remotely as a result of the global pandemic. Similarly, \\nour business travel across all forms of transport has reduced \\ndue to the effects of the global pandemic. Across some of \\nour offices we have seen an increase in water consumption, \\nowing to the need to regularly flush taps, bathrooms, kitchen \\nfacilities and vending machines across our estate. This is due \\nto them not being used in a regular capacity by the volumes \\nof colleagues which have traditionally occupied the offices.\\nWe continue to purchase renewable energy for our managed \\nestate, and this year collaborated with our landlords in our \\nleased buildings on renewable energy purchasing, in line \\nwith the Scope 1 and 2 elements of our Science-Based \\nTargets. We’re pleased to report 82% of the electricity \\nwe consume is purchased with Guarantees of Origin \\nfrom renewable sources and we continue to engage our \\nremaining landlords to transition over to procuring REGO-\\nbacked renewable electricity in the short-term.

       " 'Report to the members\\nThe Board submits its report together with the audited consolidated financial statements of \\nKPMG LLP and its subsidiary undertakings (the group) for the year ended 30 September 2020.\\nLegal structure\\nKPMG LLP is the UK member firm of the KPMG global \\norganisation of independent member firms affiliated with \\nKPMG International. Each member firm is a separate \\nand independent legal entity and describes itself as \\nsuch. All member firms are committed to following \\ncommon standards in the provision of services for clients \\nand to maintaining the highest levels of independence \\nand\\xa0integrity.\\nKPMG LLP is incorporated in the UK as a limited liability \\npartnership under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act \\n2000 and is referred to in these financial statements as \\n‘the partnership’.\\nThe partnership’s registered office is 15 Canada Square, \\nCanary Wharf, London, E14 5GL.\\nPrincipal activities\\nThe principal activities of the group are the provision of \\nprofessional services, notably audit, tax and legal, deal \\nadvisory and consulting. The group operates primarily \\nthrough the partnership and its subsidiary undertakings, \\npredominantly in the UK but also has operations in other \\ncountries as client contracts require (see note 27).\\nGovernance\\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2020, the governance \\nstructure of the partnership comprised:\\n —The Board, supported by various sub-committees \\nincluding the Audit Committee, is the main governance \\nbody of the group, responsible for overseeing the \\nstewardship, accountability and leadership of the \\ngroup, providing clear-sighted counsel on the strategic \\ndirection of the group and alignment to its vision, \\nvalues and purpose.\\n —The Executive Board, supported by four Executive \\nCommittees, is responsible for driving the board-\\napproved strategy for the group and lead on issues that \\ncut across the group.\\nFull details of the governance structures, including changes \\nin year, as well as the composition and responsibilities of \\nthe Board and related committees can be found on the \\ngroup’s website and in the group’s separately published \\nTransparency Report.Designated members\\nThe designated members (as defined in the Limited \\nLiability Partnerships Act 2000) of the partnership during \\nthe year were:\\nBill Michael \\nJeremy Barton\\nTim Jones\\nSarah Willows (resigned 31 January 2020)\\nMembers’ capital, profit shares and drawings\\nThe group is financed through a combination of members’ \\ncapital, undistributed profits and borrowing facilities. \\nMembers’ capital is provided by each member on \\nbecoming a partner and is only repayable on retirement or \\nresignation so remains relatively stable from year to year. \\nDuring the year, members receive monthly drawings and, \\nfrom time to time, additional profit share distributions. The \\nlevel and timing of the additional distributions are decided \\nby the Executive Board and approved by the Board, taking \\ninto account the group’s cash requirements for operating \\nand investing activities.\\nThe remuneration model is designed to drive and reward \\none-firm behaviour consistent with our strategy and values, \\nreflect an individual’s medium-term value as well as current \\nyear performance against their goals, and promote clarity \\nand transparency amongst members regarding their own \\nremuneration and that of other members. A member’s \\nremuneration generally comprises three elements as \\ndescribed below based on benchmark pay. Benchmark pay \\nis communicated to members in November/December \\neach year and is determined in relation to an individual’s \\nmedium-term value to the group.\\nEach member’s benchmark pay is determined with quality \\nas the primary factor and with other factors such as past \\nperformance, market value of skill set, individual capability, \\nleadership qualities and overall contribution to the group \\ntaken into account.\\nThe profit allocated to members is distributed as follows:\\nBasic profit share  – each member will receive 60% of \\ntheir benchmark pay;\\nOne Firm Profit Share  – each member will receive an \\nagreed percentage of their benchmark pay (the same \\npercentage applies to all members);\\nDiscretionary Profit Share (DPS)  – in total the same \\namount as for the One Firm Profit Share is allocated to \\nmembers on the basis of their relative in-year performance \\nagainst their balanced scorecard goals.\\nUK Financial Statements 2020\\n3\\n© 2021 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

       " 'Report to the members  \\n(continued)\\nThese elements account for the majority of the total \\nprofit allocated to members. The remainder was allocated \\nto those members who retired in the year, and who \\nreceived an additional profit share in line with the KPMG \\nLLP partnership agreement. A deduction is made from \\nthe total pay for any members if their behaviour, quality \\nor performance has fallen below the levels expected by \\nthe Executive Board, as indicated by adverse Quality and \\nRisk\\xa0metrics.\\nFinancial performance during the year\\nRevenue fell to £2,303 million (2019: £2,398 million), a \\nreduction of 4% year on year; on a like for like basis, \\nallowing for the disposal of the pensions business, net \\nsales reduced by 1% to £1,953 million (2019: £1,973 \\nmillion), reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \\non the second half of our financial year. Three of our four \\ncapabilities experienced a decline in net sales as client \\nengagements were paused at the onset of the pandemic; \\nonly Audit achieved growth in net sales, at 3%. See \\nnote 4 for net sales and contribution by capability and \\nreconciliation between revenue and net sales.\\nAs the crisis started to unfold from April 2020, we \\nimplemented a set of operational and financial resilience \\nmeasures to help offset the drop in revenue. Measures \\nsuch as reducing contractors and temporary staff, pausing \\nexternal hire, moving offices to skeleton operations and \\nreducing discretionary spend all contributed to a profit \\nbefore taxation and members’ profit shares of £403 million \\n(2019: £307 million), or £288 million excluding the profit \\non disposal of the pensions advisory business. On a like \\nfor like basis, this represented a 6% reduction in profit \\nbefore taxation and a considerably better outturn than was \\nforecast earlier in the pandemic. \\nFinancial position at the end of the year\\nThe financial position of the group remains strong at \\n30 September 2020. As set out on page 3, operations \\nare generally financed by members’ capital and other \\nmembers’ interests, which together totalled £357 million at \\n30 September 2020 (2019: £296 million) for the group and \\n£277 million (2019: £225 million) for the partnership, having \\nincreased as a result of the retention of the profit arising on \\nthe disposal of the pensions advisory business.\\nBank facilities of £475 million were also available to the \\ngroup at 30 September 2020, having increased by £90 \\nmillion in April 2020. The group’s operating activities are \\ngenerally cash generative; the borrowing of £220 million \\noutstanding at 30 September 2019 has been repaid in full \\nduring the year.\\nThe group’s and partnership’s gross assets have increased \\nto £1,665 million (2019: £1,308 million) and £1,678 million \\n(2019: £1,351 million) respectively as a result of the \\nadoption of IFRS 16, bringing all significant leases on-\\nbalance sheet; gross liabilities have similarly increased \\nto £1,313 million (2019: £1,016 million) for group and £1,401\\xa0million (2019: £1,126 million) for partnership, \\nreflecting the present value of the lease commitments.\\nThe main current assets of the group are trade receivables \\nand contract assets, both of which are monitored across \\nthe business. The prompt rendering of fees for work done \\nand collection of the resulting receivables are important \\naspects of the monitoring of financial risks within the \\ngroup. These assets totalled £740 million (2019: £889 \\nmillion) for the group and £704 million (2019: £853 million) \\nfor the partnership.\\nGoing concern\\nAs set out above, the group has access to considerable \\nfinancial resources, namely members’ capital, undistributed \\nprofits and borrowings. This funding, together with well-\\nestablished relationships with many clients and suppliers \\nacross different geographic areas and industries, leaves \\nthe group well placed to manage the financial impact of \\nour business risks, including those that have arisen as a \\nresult of COVID-19 and may arise as a result of Brexit. The \\nresilience measures taken early in the pandemic, including \\nliquidity enhancing measures such as deferral of payments \\nto partners, have improved both our immediate and longer-\\nterm resilience. At the date of this report, the majority of \\nour staff and partners continue to work remotely as we \\ncontinue to follow guidance issued by the UK government. \\nDespite these challenges, we do not expect client service \\ndelivery to be materially affected following the effective \\ntransition to remote working.\\nForecasts have been prepared for the group for the 21 \\nmonths through to 30 September 2022, reflecting on \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the possible impact on the \\ngroup’s operational activities, liquidity, borrowing facilities \\nand related covenant requirements. These forecasts reflect \\na range of downside scenarios, including a Plausible \\nbut Severe scenario that demonstrates that the group \\ncan withstand periods of reduced profitability without \\nexceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants \\nthroughout the forecast period when liquidity enhancing \\nmeasures that are readily available to the group are taken \\ninto account. Other downside scenarios demonstrate that \\nthe group can withstand periods of reduced profitability \\nwithout exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching \\ncovenants throughout the forecast period without the \\nneed to implement any further cost mitigation or liquidity \\nenhancing measures.\\nAt 30 September 2020, the group had undrawn facilities \\nof £475 million (2019: £165 million) including an additional \\nrevolving credit facility of £90 million (2019: £nil) advanced \\nin April 2020 and expiring in October 2021, with an option \\nto extend to October 2022; this level of committed, \\nundrawn funding provides strong financial resilience \\nthrough continued disruption caused by the pandemic and \\nwhen the time is right, allows the group to actively pursue, \\nrespond to and invest in opportunities in line with the \\nstrategy of the group.

       " 'Independent auditor’s report to the \\nmembers of KPMG LLP (continued)\\nConclusions relating to going concern\\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following \\nmatters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to \\nreport to you where:\\n —the members’ use of the going concern basis \\nof accounting in the preparation of the financial \\nstatements is not appropriate; or\\n —the members have not disclosed in the financial \\nstatements any identified material uncertainties that \\nmay cast significant doubt about the group’s or the \\npartnership’s ability to continue to adopt the going \\nconcern basis of accounting for a period of at least \\ntwelve months from the date when the financial \\nstatements are authorised for issue.In our evaluation of the member’ conclusions, we \\nconsidered the risks associated with the group’s and \\npartnership’s business, including effects arising from \\nmacro-economic uncertainties such as COVID-19 and \\nBrexit, and analysed how those risks might affect the \\ngroup’s and partnership’s financial resources or ability to \\ncontinue operations over the period of at least twelve \\nmonths from the date when the financial statements are \\nauthorised for issue. In accordance with the above, we \\nhave nothing to report in these respects. \\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or \\nconditions and as subsequent events may result in \\noutcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were \\nreasonable at the time they were made, the absence of \\nreference to a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report \\nis not a guarantee that the group or the partnership will \\ncontinue in operation. \\nOverview of our audit approach\\n —Overall materiality: £11 .5 million, which represented 5% of the group’s profit before taxation, disposal \\nof business and members’ profit share, at the planning stage of the audit. We decided not to revise \\nmateriality once the final results were known;\\n —Key audit matters were identified as revenue recognition includes the risk of fraud, professional claims and \\nregulatory matters, impairment of goodwill, and going concern; and\\n —We performed a full scope audit of the financial statements of the partnership and on the financial \\ninformation of certain significant subsidiaries. We completed specified or analytical audit procedures on \\nthe financial information of all other subsidiaries.\\nKey audit matters\\nThe partnership’s members have requested us to expand our auditor’s report to report under ISA (UK) 701 \\n‘Communicating Key Audit Matters in the Independent Auditor’s Report’. This involves communicating to the members \\nkey audit matters together with other audit planning and scoping matters. \\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the \\nfinancial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement \\n(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall \\naudit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters \\nwere addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and \\nwe do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\nUK Financial Statements 2020\\n7\\n© 2021 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Revenue is recognised \\nat an amount that depicts the transaction price of the \\ntransfer of professional services to a customer.\\nThe majority of the group’s revenue is derived from \\ncontracts where the consideration is based on time \\nand materials. For these contracts, the group satisfies \\nperformance obligations over time and revenue is \\nrecognised in proportion to cost incurred relative \\nto total expected cost required to complete the \\nsatisfaction of that performance obligation. \\nIn determining the timing of revenue to be \\nrecognised in accordance with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue \\nfrom Contracts with Customers’ each individual \\nengagement team estimates the stage of completion \\nand the right to consideration at the year-end for \\neach contract. The level of judgement and estimation \\nrequired is higher when related to revenues which \\nremain unbilled to the customer at the year end. The \\nvalue of revenue recognised at the year end, which \\nremained unbilled, amounted to £310 million (2019: \\n£334 million) for the group. \\nWithin this population we identified a further \\npopulation of significant contracts with specific risks \\nor characteristics with unbilled revenue recognised \\namounting to £223 million for the group which, in \\nour view, had a greater susceptibility to material \\nmisstatement arising from the risk of fraud or error. \\nWe therefore identified revenue recognition includes \\nthe risk of fraud as a significant risk for this population \\nof contracts which was one of the most significant \\nassessed risks of material misstatement.Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:\\n —gaining an understanding of the processes and relevant \\ncontrols implemented by management to identify, measure \\nand recognise revenue, including unbilled revenue; assessing \\nthe design effectiveness of those processes and controls and \\ntesting the operating effectiveness of certain key controls;\\n —assessing the accounting policies and practices relating to \\nrevenue recognition to establish compliance with IFRS 15;\\n —performing substantive testing on a sample of engagements \\nto assess that the right to consideration had been \\nobtained through performance of the agreed services;\\n —for individually significant engagements where we \\nidentified specific risks or characteristics, discussing and \\nchallenging the estimates applied by engagement and \\nmanagement teams in determining the level of revenue \\nrecognised in the consolidated income statement \\nand the unbilled revenue recognised within the group \\nand partnership statements of financial position;\\n —making enquiries of engagement and management teams \\nwhere revenues recognised or trends fell outside our \\nexpectation parameters. We sought corroborating evidence \\nto support explanations provided by those teams; and\\n —considering the adequacy of the disclosures \\nrelated to revenue recognition.\\nKey observations\\nOur audit testing did not identify any significant deficiencies in the \\nrevenue recognition policies and practices and we did not identify \\na material misstatement in revenue recognition as a result of the \\nrisk of fraud.\\nOverall, our assessment is that the estimates applied in \\ndetermining the level of revenue resulted in an appropriate level \\nof revenue recognised in the consolidated income statement and \\nunbilled revenue within the group and partnership statements of \\nfinancial\\xa0position.\\nWe consider the related disclosure in note 4 to the financial \\nstatements appropriately discloses and describes the significant \\ndegree of inherent uncertainty in the assumptions and estimates \\nused in determining the stage of completion of revenue contracts.\\nUK Financial Statements 2020\\n8\\n© 2021 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

In \\nperforming that impairment review, management \\ncompare the recoverable amount of the goodwill \\nwith its net book value.

The \\nfinancial statements are presented in millions of pounds \\n(£m) unless stated otherwise.\\nGoing Concern\\nAs set out in the Report to the members, the group \\nhas access to considerable financial resources, namely \\nmembers’ capital, undistributed profits and borrowings. \\nThis funding, together with well-established relationships \\nwith many clients and suppliers across different geographic \\nareas and industries, leaves the group well placed to \\nmanage the financial impact of our business risks, including \\nthose that have arisen as a result of COVID-19 and may \\narise as a result of Brexit. The resilience measures taken \\nearly in the pandemic, including liquidity enhancing \\nmeasures such as deferral of payments to partners, have \\nimproved our immediate and longer-term resilience. At the \\ndate of this report, the majority of our staff and partners \\ncontinue to work remotely as we continue to follow \\nguidance issued by the UK government. Despite these \\nchallenges, we do not expect client service delivery to \\nbe materially affected following the effective transition to \\nremote working.\\nForecasts have been prepared for the group for the 21 \\nmonths through to 30 September 2022, reflecting on \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the possible impact on the \\ngroup’s operational activities, liquidity, borrowing facilities \\nand related covenant requirements. These forecasts reflect \\na range of downside scenarios, including a Plausible \\nbut Severe scenario that demonstrates that the group \\ncan withstand periods of reduced profitability without \\nexceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants \\nthroughout the forecast period when liquidity enhancing \\nmeasures that are readily available to the group are taken \\ninto account. Other downside scenarios demonstrate that \\nthe group can withstand periods of reduced profitability \\nwithout exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching \\ncovenants throughout the forecast period without the \\nneed to implement any further cost mitigation or liquidity \\nenhancing measures.At 30 September 2020, the group had undrawn facilities \\nof £475 million (2019: £165 million) including an additional \\nrevolving credit facility of £90 million (2019: £nil) advanced \\nin April 2020 and expiring in October 2021, with an option \\nto extend to October 2022; this level of committed, \\nundrawn funding provides strong financial resilience \\nthrough continued disruption caused by the pandemic and, \\nwhen the time is right, allows the group to actively pursue, \\nrespond to and invest in opportunities in line with the \\nstrategy of the group. Full details of the borrowing facilities \\nare set out in note 17 .\\nThe group’s objectives, policies and processes to address \\nrisks arising from the group’s use of financial instruments, \\nin particular its exposure to market, credit and liquidity risks \\nare set out in note 23.\\nFollowing a review of the group’s profit and cash flow \\nforecasts and consideration of wider business risks faced \\nby the group, (as set out in the group’s separately published \\nTransparency Report) the Board has concluded that, at the \\ntime of approving these financial statements, the group has \\nadequate resources to continue in operational existence \\nfor the foreseeable future and at least 12 months from the \\ndate of this report. Accordingly, the Board continues to \\nadopt the going concern basis in preparing this report and \\nfinancial statements.\\nForeign currency\\nTransactions in each entity in foreign currencies other than \\nits functional currency are recorded at the foreign exchange \\nrate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the \\nyear-end date are retranslated in each entity at the foreign \\nexchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange \\ndifferences arising on translation are recognised in the \\nincome statement within financial income or expense, as \\nappropriate. Non-monetary assets that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in foreign currency are translated \\nusing the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\\nFor presentation purposes, the revenues and expenses \\nof group undertakings with a functional currency other \\nthan pounds sterling are translated at an average rate for \\nthe period where this rate approximates to the foreign \\nexchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. \\nThe assets and liabilities of such undertakings, \\nincluding goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on \\nconsolidation, are translated at foreign exchange rates \\nruling at year-end. Exchange differences arising from this \\nretranslation are recognised in other comprehensive \\nincome in the translation reserve.1 .

       " 'Notes\\nForming part of the consolidated financial statementsImpairment\\nNon-financial assets\\nThe carrying amounts of the group’s and partnership’s \\nnon-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are \\nreviewed at each reporting date to determine whether \\nthere is any indication of impairment. If any such indication \\nexists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. \\nFor goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated each year \\nat the same time.\\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of \\nits value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In \\nassessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are \\ndiscounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount \\nrate that reflects current market assessments of the time \\nvalue of money and the risks specific to the asset. \\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that \\ncannot be tested individually are grouped together into \\nthe smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows \\nfrom continuing use that are largely independent of the \\ncash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the \\ncash-generating unit (or CGU)). The goodwill acquired in \\na business combination, for the purpose of impairment \\ntesting, is allocated to CGUs.\\nSubject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the \\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which \\ngoodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the \\nlevel at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest \\nlevel at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting \\npurposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is \\nallocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit \\nfrom the synergies of the combination.\\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount \\nof an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable \\namount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income \\nstatement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of \\nCGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of \\nany goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the \\ncarrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of \\nunits) on a pro rata basis.\\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. \\nIn respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised \\nin prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for \\nany indications that the loss has decreased or no longer \\nexists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a \\nchange in the estimates used to determine the recoverable \\namount. \\nAn impairment loss is reversed only to the extent \\nthat the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the \\ncarrying amount that would have been determined, net \\nof depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had \\nbeen recognised.2. Changes in significant accounting policies\\nThe group and partnership have initially applied IFRS 16 \\nfrom 1 October 2019. As a result, the group and partnership \\nhave changed their accounting policy for lease contracts as \\ndetailed below.\\nIFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (IFRS 16)\\nThe group and partnership have initially applied IFRS 16 \\nfrom 1 October 2019, using the modified retrospective \\napproach, under which the cumulative effect of initial \\napplication is recognised in retained earnings at 1 October \\n2019. \\nDefinition of a lease\\nPreviously, the group and partnership determined at \\ncontract inception whether an arrangement is or contains \\na lease under IFRIC 4. Under IFRS 16, the group and \\npartnership assess whether a contract is or contains a \\nlease based on the definition of a lease, as explained in \\nnote 24. \\nOn transition to IFRS 16, the group and partnership elected \\nto apply the practical expedient to apply IFRS 16 only \\nto contracts that were previously identified as leases. \\nContracts that were not previously identified as leases \\nunder IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 were not reassessed as to \\nwhether there is a lease. Therefore, the definition of a lease \\nunder IFRS 16 was applied only to contracts entered into or \\nchanged on or after 1 October 2019.\\nAs a lessee\\nThe group and partnership previously classified leases \\nas operating leases based on its assessment that the \\nlease did not transfer significantly all of the risks and \\nrewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset \\nto the group and partnership. Under IFRS 16, the group \\nand partnership recognise right-of-use assets and lease \\nliabilities for most leases – these leases are therefore \\nrecognised on-balance sheet.\\nLeases classified as operating leases under IAS 17\\nAt transition, lease liabilities were measured at the present \\nvalue of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the \\ngroup’s and partnership’s incremental borrowing rate as at \\n1 October 2019. Right-of-use assets were measured at an \\namount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount \\nof any prepaid or accrued lease payments: the group and \\npartnership applied this approach to all leases.1 .

Revenue \\nAll revenue of the group and partnership is generated from \\ncontracts with customers.\\nAccounting policy \\nRevenue is recognised when the group and partnership \\nhave satisfied performance obligations by transferring \\ncontrol of services to clients. Revenue includes recoverable \\nexpenses incurred on client assignments but excluding \\nvalue added tax. \\nRecoverable expenses represent charges from other KPMG \\nInternational member firms, sub-contractors and out-of-\\npocket expenses incurred in respect of assignments and \\nexpected to be recovered from clients.\\nRevenue is recognised at an amount that depicts the \\ntransaction price of the transfer of professional services \\nto a customer. Variable consideration, such as fee \\narrangements contingent on the occurrence or non-\\noccurrence of a future event, is included in the transaction \\nprice only to the extent that it is highly probable that \\na significant reversal will not be required when the \\nuncertainties determining the level of variable consideration \\nare subsequently resolved. \\nThe majority of the group’s revenue is derived from \\ncontracts where the consideration is based on time \\nand materials. For these contracts the group satisfies \\nperformance obligations over time and revenue is \\nrecognised based on the rate agreed with the client, \\nprovided there is an enforceable right to payment for \\nperformance completed to date.\\nSimilarly, revenue derived from fixed fee contracts is \\nrecognised over time based on the actual service provided \\nto the end of the reporting period relative to total services \\nto be provided, generally assessed by reference to actual \\ninputs of time and expenses as a proportion of the total \\nexpected inputs, where there is an enforceable right to \\npayment for performance completed to date. \\nFor contingent fee contracts, including certain Deal \\nAdvisory engagements where the group are providing deal \\nsupport, consideration is constrained in estimating revenue \\nand recognised at a point in time when the contingency is \\nresolved and the firm has an entitlement to payment. \\nWhere contracts include multiple performance obligations, \\nthe transaction price is allocated to each performance \\nobligation based on its stand-alone selling price, reflecting \\nexpected cost plus margin or stand-alone selling price if \\nrelevant.Invoices are issued in accordance with the terms of \\nengagement; except where consideration is variable, fees \\nare usually billed on account based on a payment schedule \\nand standard payment terms are usually 30 days from date \\nof issue. \\nWhere revenue recognised by the group and partnership \\nexceeds the amounts invoiced, a ‘Contract asset’ is \\nrecognised within ‘Trade and other receivables’. Invoices \\nraised in excess of revenue recognised by the group and \\npartnership are classified as ‘Contract liabilities’ within \\n‘Trade and other payables’. \\nSignificant estimate\\nIn calculating revenue from service contracts, the group \\nand partnership make certain estimates as to the extent \\nto which performance obligations have been satisfied. In \\ndoing so, the group and partnership estimate the remaining \\ntime and external costs to be incurred in completing \\ncontracts and the clients’ willingness and ability to pay for \\nthe services provided. These estimates depend upon the \\noutcome of future events and may need to be revised as \\ncircumstances change.\\nCertain service contracts, notably those in Deal Advisory, \\nConsulting and Tax & Legal, require a greater degree of \\nestimation than others, specifically those contracts that:\\n —are long-term, spanning a number of accounting \\nperiods, thereby extending the period over which \\nestimation is required;\\n —have fee arrangements other than a simple time \\nand materials basis, requiring an estimation as to \\npercentage completion over time; \\n —have multiple deliverables, such as software \\nimplementation and support services, requiring an \\nestimate as to revenue allocation to each deliverable \\nor percentage completion over time if the contract is \\nconsidered to be a single performance obligation.\\nEstimates of revenue, costs or extent of progress toward \\ncompletion are revised if circumstances change.

Any resulting increases or \\ndecreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected \\nin the income statement in the period in which the \\ncircumstances arose.

Acquisitions and disposals \\nAccounting policy\\nFor business combinations, fair values that reflect \\nconditions at the date of the business combination and \\nthe terms of each business combination are attributed \\nto the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent \\nliabilities acquired. For business combinations achieved \\nin stages, the group revalues its investment to the fair \\nvalue reflecting the conditions at the date of acquisition \\nof the controlling share with any resultant gain or loss \\nrecognised in the income statement. Consideration for \\nthe business combination is measured at the fair value of \\nassets transferred to and liabilities incurred on behalf of the \\nprevious owners of the acquiree. Goodwill is recognised \\nwhere the consideration for the business combination \\nexceeds the fair values of identifiable assets, liabilities and \\ncontingent liabilities acquired. Where the excess is positive, \\nit is treated as an intangible asset, subject to annual \\nimpairment testing. \\nTransaction costs that the group incurs in connection with a \\nbusiness combination, such as legal fees, are expensed as \\nincurred. \\nNon-controlling interests arise where the group holds less \\nthan 100% of the shares in the entities acquired or, as a \\nresult of agreements in place, is entitled to less than 100% \\nof profits or losses arising. Non-controlling interests are \\nmeasured on initial recognition at their share of the relevant \\nnet assets. \\nIntangible assets have been recognised in respect of \\ncustomer relationships and similar assets (see note 12).\\nAcquisitions and disposals \\nThere were no acquisitions during the year ended 30 \\nSeptember 2020, and no acquisitions or disposals in the \\nyear ended 30 September 2019.\\nDisposals – year ended 30 September 2020\\nIn December 2019, KPMG LLP entered into a conditional \\nagreement to sell its pensions advisory business. The \\nconditions for sale were met during 2020 and the sale \\ncompleted on 2 March 2020, resulting in the transfer of \\n20 partners and approximately 500 staff employed by the \\nbusiness at the date of completion, together with certain \\nclient contracts and related contract assets.\\nAfter allowing for amounts paid to partners of the pensions \\nadvisory business, the net consideration due to KPMG as \\na result of the sale was £128 million. After adjusting for net \\nassets transferred and costs of disposal, the profit on sale \\nof the business was £115 million. \\nHad the disposal taken place at 1 October 2019, the \\nrevenue and contribution of the group and partnership \\nwould have been reduced by £24 million and £11 million \\nrespectively. 11. Property, plant and equipment \\nAccounting policy \\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Parts of \\nan item of property, plant and equipment having different \\nuseful lives are accounted for as separate items. \\nDepreciation is provided to write off the cost less the \\nestimated residual value of property, plant and equipment \\nand is charged to the income statement on a straight-line \\nbasis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item \\nof property, plant and equipment.

The assumptions applied beyond four years are more prudent as shown below:\\n2020 2019\\nPeriod on which management approved forecasts are based 4 years 4 years\\nGrowth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 0 - 2% 0%\\nDiscount rate 9.2 - 12.3% 8.4 - 9.6%\\nThe growth rates used in the value in use calculation reflect a conservative view given the past performance of these \\nCGUs and uncertainties around further market growth in these capabilities beyond the initial 4 year forecast period. \\nWhere the calculated recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value, no impairment arises. A reasonable change \\nin the key assumptions does not have a significant impact on the difference between value in use and carrying value \\nexcept in the case of Microsoft Business Solutions (formerly KPMG Crimsonwing) where profitability of the CGU is \\nforecast to improve considerably over the next four years. Sensitivity analysis on a range of scenarios suggests that any \\ndelay in returning to profitable trading or 50% reduction in the level of future growth compared to forecasts would result \\nin an impairment arising against the carrying value of goodwill.

Subsequent to initial recognition, \\nnon-current loans and receivables are recorded at amortised cost less impairment losses. \\nJudgement \\nAs set out in more detail below, under the Asset Backed Funding (ABF) agreement, the partnership has a receivable from \\nthe Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP) of £39 million (2019: £37 million). \\nThe partnership expects to recover its initial contribution of £30 million on future termination of the ABF plus an additional \\nsum, up to a maximum £60 million.\\nThe amount of the additional flow is determined by a number of variables, the most significant of which is considered \\nto be non-financial in nature. Management has therefore concluded that whilst there is no embedded derivative, the \\nreceivable does not meet the ‘solely principal and interest’ test under IFRS 9 and has been recorded at fair value as a \\nFVTPL asset. Fair value of £39 million (2019: £37 million) is calculated based on cashflows, discounted at the rate inherent \\nin the ABF agreement.\\nGroup Partnership\\n2020  \\n£m2019  \\n£m2020  \\n£m2019  \\n£m\\nOther prepayments - - 47 49\\nAmounts due from other UK group undertakings - - 39 37\\nDeferred tax assets (see note 20) 6 5 - -\\nOther non-current assets 6 5 86 86\\nAmounts due to other UK group undertakings - - 90 90\\nOther non-current liabilities - - 90 90\\nPartnership \\nUnder the ABF arrangement (see note 21), the partnership prepaid £60 million into the defined benefit plans, £52 million \\nin the pre-2000 fund and £8 million in the TMcL fund, at the inception of the agreement. Under the agreement the SLP , \\na group entity set up on inception of the agreement, makes monthly payments totalling £4.5 million per annum to the \\npension plans for 25 years from the date of implementation. The prepayment of £60 million is therefore expected to \\nreduce to £nil over the period of 25 years with the discount unwinding through financial income. \\nAt 30 September 2020, the prepayment was £51 million (2019: £53 million); £47 million (2019: £49 million) is non-current, \\nwhilst the remaining £4 million (2019: £4 million) is current, classified as other prepayments within trade and other \\nreceivables. \\nIn addition, at the inception of the ABF , the partnership contributed £30 million to the SLP which it expects to recover \\non future termination of the ABF . It is expected that the pension deficits would reduce over the period and therefore the \\nABF would generate a return of £60 million to the partnership at the end of the 25 year life. At 30 September 2020, a \\nreceivable balance of £39 million is classified as amounts due from other UK undertakings within other non-current assets \\nwith the discount unwinding through financial income (2019: £37 million). \\nAlso under the ABF , the partnership has transferred £90 million of its trade receivables to the SLP (see note 21). As the \\npartnership retains the risks and rewards of those receivables it has a corresponding liability, reflecting the amount owed \\nto the SLP under this agreement. A financial expense of £4.5 million has been recognised in the partnership’s income \\nstatement in respect of the unwinding discount on this liability.\\nUK Financial Statements 2020\\n41\\n© 2021 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

T rade and other receivables \\nAccounting policy \\nTrade and other receivables (except contract assets) are initially recognised at their transaction price.

At 30 September 2020, the ECL was assessed to be £19 million for the group (2019: £9 million) and £18 million \\nfor the partnership (2019: £8 million). However, a different assessment of the probability of default in respect of these \\nclients and industries would result in a different level of ECL; an increase in the weighted average loss rate by 1% would \\nresult in recognition of a further £9 million of ECL for both group and partnership.\\nImpairment \\nThe group and partnership recognise loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets measured at \\namortised cost and contract assets (as defined in IFRS 15). The loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime \\nECLs.\\nWhen estimating ECL, the group and partnership considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and \\navailable without undue cost or effort.

These \\nannuities are payable only out of profits of the partnership, on which they constitute a first charge. The present value of \\nthe best estimate of the expected liabilities for future payments to retired members or their dependants is provided in \\nfull, gross of attributable taxation that is deducted by KPMG from payments to annuitants, as a charge against income at \\nthe point at which the contractual right arises. Any changes in the provision for former members’ annuities arising from \\nchanges in former members and their dependants or in financial estimates and actuarial assumptions are recognised in \\nthe income statement. \\nThe unwinding of the discount is presented in the income statement as a financial expense. The payment of former \\nmembers’ annuities is shown as a movement against the provision. \\nThe group maintains professional indemnity insurance, principally written through mutual insurance companies. Premiums \\nare expensed as they fall due with prepayments or accruals being recognised accordingly. Expected reimbursement is \\nrecognised once they become receivable. Where outflow of resources is considered probable and reliable estimates \\ncan be made, provision is made for the cost (including related legal costs) of settling professional service claims brought \\nagainst the partnership and group by third parties and disciplinary proceedings brought by regulatory authorities. \\nAmounts provided for are based on management’s assessment of the specific circumstances in each case.

No deferred tax assets arise in respect of tax losses at 30 \\nSeptember 2020 (2019: £0.2 million recognised in respect of tax losses totalling £1 million).\\n21. Retirement benefits\\nAccounting policy\\nThe group operates two defined contribution pension plans for which the charge for the year represents the contributions \\npayable to the plans in respect of the accounting period. An accrual or prepayment is included in the statement of financial \\nposition to the extent to which such costs do not equate to the cash contributions paid in the year.\\nThe group also operates two defined benefit pension plans for which the partnership is the sponsoring employer and \\nbears all related risks. Both plans are closed to future accrual of benefits. The group’s net obligations in respect of its \\ndefined benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the benefits that former employees have \\nearned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair \\nvalue of plan assets (at bid price) is deducted.\\nThe group determines the net interest on the net defined benefit liability for the period based on a spot rate approach. \\nUnder this approach the full yield curve which has been used to derive the discount rate used to measure the defined \\nbenefit obligation is applied to the expected cash flows from the pension schemes in each year. This gives an average \\nrate of interest which is applied to the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the annual period adjusted for \\ncontributions and benefit payments during the period.\\nThe discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation is based on a yield curve which has been derived \\nbased on information regarding AA-rated corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. The group determines a single \\nequivalent discount rate based on this yield curve being applied to sample pension scheme cash flows that broadly match \\nthe profile of the group’s pension schemes.

       " 'Notes\\nForming part of the consolidated financial statementsRisks\\nThe pension plans expose the group to several key risks, \\nthe most significant of which are detailed below:\\n —Default risk  – the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan \\nhave a fully credit-based investment strategy based \\non buying and holding credit instruments which are \\nexpected to deliver the income required in order to \\npay members’ pensions, reducing the volatility of the \\nfinancial position of the schemes. One of the key risks \\nof this type of ‘buy and hold’ strategy is default risk: \\nthe risk that the credit instruments don’t deliver the \\nexpected income due to default. This risk is managed \\nby investing primarily in investment grade credit \\ninstruments which are expected to have a lower risk of \\ndefault as well as investing in a well diversified portfolio \\nof assets.\\n —Reinvestment risk  – the ‘buy and hold’ strategy \\nmentioned above generates excess asset income in \\nthe short term which would need to be reinvested in \\nthe future in order to continue meeting the expected \\nbenefits for members over the longer term. There is a \\nrisk that this income is reinvested at worse terms than \\nassumed, which might mean that further contributions \\nare required from the group in the future. The scenario \\nwhere this may apply (narrowing credit spreads) \\nis likely to be during a more buoyant economic \\nenvironment which is likely to be beneficial for the \\ngroup more generally. \\n —Mortality risk  – the assumptions adopted by the \\ngroup make allowance for future improvements in life \\nexpectancy. However, if life expectancy improves at a \\nfaster rate than assumed, this would result in greater \\npayments from the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL \\nplan and consequently increases in the liabilities. The \\ngroup and Trustee of each plan review the mortality \\nassumptions on a regular basis to minimise the risk of \\nusing an inappropriate assumption.\\nOther matters\\nThe group expects to contribute approximately £4.5 million \\n(which is made up entirely of payments from the ABF \\narrangement – see below) to its defined benefit pension \\nplans in the next financial year.\\nEffective from 29 September 2014, KPMG LLP entered \\ninto an ABF agreement with the pension plans through \\nthe establishment of a Scottish Limited Partnership \\n(SLP). Under this agreement, the beneficial interest in \\ncertain trade receivables to a fair value of £90 million was \\ntransferred to the SLP . The transfer was effected via a \\nreceivables purchase agreement, which sets out how £90 \\nmillion of the group’s receivables will be transferred to the \\nSLP for a 25-year period from the date of implementation.21 . Retirement benefits (continued)\\nThe plans have a limited interest in the SLP and are entitled \\nto combined annual distribution from the profits of the SLP \\nof £4.5 million (£3.9 million pre-2000 fund; £0.6 million \\nTMcL plan) payable monthly for 25 years from the date \\nof implementation. The payments to a plan will cease if it \\nreaches a fully funded status determined using a low-risk \\nmeasure of the plan’s liabilities.\\nThe SLP is controlled by the group and its results are \\nconsolidated by the group. The group’s statement of \\nfinancial position, IAS 19 deficit and income statement \\nare unchanged by the establishment of the SLP . The \\ninvestment held by the plans in the SLP does not qualify \\nas a plan asset for the purposes of the group’s financial \\nstatements and is therefore not included within the fair \\nvalue of plan assets. The value of the trade receivables \\ntransferred to the SLP remains on the group’s statement of \\nfinancial position. \\nAs a result of the transactions under the ABF , the \\npartnership’s statement of financial position, at the \\ninception of the agreement, was changed to reflect its \\nreceivable from the SLP of £30 million, prepayment of \\ncontributions to the pension funds of £60 million and \\na liability of £90 million arising under the receivables \\npurchase agreement. The IAS 19 deficit and income \\nstatement were unchanged.\\nBecause taxation in the partnership is a personal liability \\nof the individual members, no deferred tax on the plans’ \\nbalances falls to be recorded in the financial statements of \\nboth the group and partnership.\\nThe High Court ruled on 26 October 2018 in the landmark \\nLloyds Banking Group case on the equalisation of \\nGuaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP). The judgement \\nrequires equalisation between men and women for the \\neffect of unequal GMPs and the impact of this decision \\nwas accounted for at 30 September 2019. \\nThis does not affect the pre-2000 fund but does affect the \\nTMcL plan, as this arrangement was contracted out of \\nthe State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The group \\nincluded an allowance of 1 .2% of the TMcL plan’s defined \\nbenefit obligation for the impact of the GMP equalisation at \\n30 September 2019 and the estimated increase in liabilities \\nwas recognised as a past service cost within the income \\nstatement for the year ended 30 September 2019. The \\nsame approach has been taken to derive the TMcL plan \\ndefined benefit obligation at 30 September 2020. On 20 \\nNovember 2020, the High Court handed down a further \\njudgement confirming that defined benefit schemes which \\nprovide GMPs need to revisit and, where necessary, top \\nup historical cash equivalent transfer values that were \\ncalculated based on unequalised benefits. We consider that \\nthis latest judgement creates an additional obligation for \\nthe TMcL plan from the date of the judgement. \\nUK Financial Statements 2020\\n51\\n© 2021 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

The fair value of forward exchange \\ncontracts, swaps and interest rate caps is the estimated amount that the group or partnership would receive or pay \\nat the year-end, taking into account current exchange rates, interest rates and the current credit worthiness of swap \\ncounterparties.\\nRisk management framework\\nThe group’s principal financial instruments arise directly from its operations. Members’ capital and amounts due to and \\nfrom members also fall to be treated as financial instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to \\nfinance the operations of the group.\\nThe group has exposure to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk arising from its use of financial instruments. This note \\npresents information about the exposure of both the group and partnership to each of the above risks and the objectives, \\npolicies and processes for measuring and managing risk.\\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework. The risk \\nmanagement policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits \\nand controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly \\nto reflect changes in market conditions and activities. The group, through training and management standards and \\nprocedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their \\nroles and obligations.\\nFurther quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.\\na) Accounting classifications and fair values\\nThe estimated fair values of the group’s financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying values at 30 September \\n2020 and 2019, largely owing to their short maturity. The bases for determining fair values are disclosed throughout these \\nfinancial statements.\\nThe table on page 60 shows the classification and carrying amounts of the group’s and partnership’s financial assets and \\nfinancial liabilities. The only assets designated at fair value for the group are the bonds, equities and other investments \\nshown on the table on page 60; the partnership has only non-current amounts due from other UK group undertakings \\ncarried at fair value at 30 September 2020.\\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair \\nvalues are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy as follows:\\n —Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\\n —Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either \\ndirectly (for example, as prices) or indirectly (for example, derived from prices); and\\n —Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\\nAll assets designated at fair value are classified as Level 1 with the exception of other investments and non-current \\namounts due from other UK group undertakings which are classified as Level 3 and valued using discounted cash flows. \\nThere have been no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the current or prior year.23.

No separate disclosure is made of the details of such claims or proceedings, or \\nany related recoveries, as to do so could seriously prejudice the position of the group.\\n26. Related parties\\nThe group has a related party relationship with its key management, considered to be the members of the Board and the \\nExecutive Board who were also individual members of the partnership.\\nT ransactions with key management\\nThe members of the UK Board and the Executive Board are responsible for planning, directing and controlling the \\nactivities of the group. The members of the UK Board and the Executive Board all share in the profits of the partnership \\nand the following disclosures relate to those members only. \\nAs set out in note 6, the partnership does not finalise the division of profits amongst members until after the financial \\nstatements have been finalised and approved by the members. The estimated profit entitlement due to the partnership’s \\nkey management in respect of the current year totalled £17 .6 million. The actual profit allocated in respect of the previous \\nyear was £21 .3 million.\\nThe estimated total profit share payable to the highest paid member is £2.1 million, of which normal remuneration for the \\nperiod represented £1 .1 million (2019: highest paid £1 .9 million) and the balance an additional amount paid under the firm’s \\npartner retirement provisions.\\nThere were no balances due to or from key management at 30 September 2020 or 2019 save in respect of relevant \\nshares of profit (or related taxation), shares of historical reserves and members’ capital.\\nUK Financial Statements 2020\\n69\\n© 2021 KPMG LLP , a UK limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

In November 2019, \\nwe achieved certification to ISO50001, the standard for \\nEnergy Management Systems (EnMS). The development of the system has enabled us to monitor and report \\nenergy consumption more effectively and identify areas for \\ncontinual improvement.

However, our natural \\ngas has remained broadly the same as the lockdown \\noccurred during the warmer months.\\nThis year we also deployed remote collaboration technology \\nacross the firm.

One of the key risks of this type of ‘buy and hold’ strategy is default risk: the risk that the credit instruments don’t deliver the expected income due to default.

       " 'The group and partnership recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and, if relevant, an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received',\n",
       " 'The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. The estimated useful life of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability',\n",
       " 'The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group and partnership’s incremental borrowing rate',\n",
       " 'Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:  —fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;  —variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;  —the exercise price under a purchase option that the group and partnership are reasonably certain to exercise;  —lease payments in an optional renewal period if the group and partnership are reasonably certain to exercise an extension option; and  —penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group and partnership are reasonably certain not to terminate early.The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured if the group and partnership changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option',\n",
       " 'When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero',\n",
       " 'The group presents right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘non-current liabilities’ and ‘current liabilities’ in the statement of financial position',\n",
       " 'Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The group and partnership have elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease of low-value assets and short-term leases. The group and partnership recognise the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term',\n",
       " 'As a lessorAs an intermediate lessor, the group and partnership accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the group and partnership applied the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease',\n",

       " 'The most significant impact of management’s assessment regarding the exercise of the extension or terminate options relates to office buildings. Where practicable, the group and partnership seek to include an extension or terminate option in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the group and partnership and not by the lessors. The group and partnership assess at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise either the extension or termination options. The group and partnership reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances during the life of the lease',\n",
       " 'During the year ended 30 September 2021, the group and partnership have reassessed the likely future use of property currently leased as a result of a number of factors including the exit of the restructuring business and moves to hybrid working. Taking into account these factors management have determined that it is more likely that termination options will be invoked in certain properties and certain property assets have been impaired (see page 68), reflecting a commitment as to the exercise of termination options and future use of the property. A different assessment as to the exit of these properties would result in a different net book value for the assets and lease liabilities recognised at 30\\xa0September 2021 .23. Leases (continued)Leases as a lesseeThe group and partnership lease a number of office facilities',\n",
       " 'The periods of the leases vary between 1-25 years; lease payments are generally subject to rent review every five years. The group also leases certain IT equipment, IT data storage facilities, office equipment and motor vehicles',\n",

These forecasts reflect a range of downside scenarios, including a Plausible but Severe scenario that demonstrates that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability without exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants throughout the forecast period when liquidity enhancing measures that are readily available to the group are taken into account. Other downside scenarios demonstrate that the group can withstand periods of reduced profitability without exceeding borrowing facilities or breaching covenants throughout the forecast period without the need to implement any further cost mitigation or liquidity enhancing measures.At 30 September 2020, the group had undrawn facilities of £475 million (2019: £165 million) including an additional revolving credit facility of £90 million (2019: £nil) advanced in April 2020 and expiring in October 2021, with an option to extend to October 2022; this level of committed, undrawn funding provides strong financial resilience through continued disruption caused by the pandemic and, when the time is right, allows the group to actively pursue, respond to and invest in opportunities in line with the strategy of the group.

However, since both the defined benefit plans are in deficit and the deficit in the pre-2000 fund exceeds the present value of future committed contributions, IFRIC 14 has no impact on the pension liabilities or disclosures (2019: £nil) at 30 September 2020.21 .

       " 'NotesForming part of the consolidated financial statementsRisksThe pension plans expose the group to several key risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: —Default risk  – the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan have a fully credit-based investment strategy based on buying and holding credit instruments which are expected to deliver the income required in order to pay members’ pensions, reducing the volatility of the financial position of the schemes. One of the key risks of this type of ‘buy and hold’ strategy is default risk: the risk that the credit instruments don’t deliver the expected income due to default. This risk is managed by investing primarily in investment grade credit instruments which are expected to have a lower risk of default as well as investing in a well diversified portfolio of assets',\n",
       " ' —Reinvestment risk  – the ‘buy and hold’ strategy mentioned above generates excess asset income in the short term which would need to be reinvested in the future in order to continue meeting the expected benefits for members over the longer term. There is a risk that this income is reinvested at worse terms than assumed, which might mean that further contributions are required from the group in the future. The scenario where this may apply (narrowing credit spreads) is likely to be during a more buoyant economic environment which is likely to be beneficial for the group more generally',\n",
       " ' —Mortality risk  – the assumptions adopted by the group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the pre-2000 fund and the TMcL plan and consequently increases in the liabilities. The group and Trustee of each plan review the mortality assumptions on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate assumption',\n",
       " 'Other mattersThe group expects to contribute approximately £4.5 million (which is made up entirely of payments from the ABF arrangement – see below) to its defined benefit pension plans in the next financial year',\n",
       " 'Effective from 29 September 2014, KPMG LLP entered into an ABF agreement with the pension plans through the establishment of a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP). Under this agreement, the beneficial interest in certain trade receivables to a fair value of £90 million was transferred to the SLP . The transfer was effected via a receivables purchase agreement, which sets out how £90 million of the group’s receivables will be transferred to the SLP for a 25-year period from the date of implementation.21 . Retirement benefits (continued)The plans have a limited interest in the SLP and are entitled to combined annual distribution from the profits of the SLP of £4.5 million (£3.9 million pre-2000 fund; £0.6 million TMcL plan) payable monthly for 25 years from the date of implementation. The payments to a plan will cease if it reaches a fully funded status determined using a low-risk measure of the plan’s liabilities',\n",
       " 'The SLP is controlled by the group and its results are consolidated by the group. The group’s statement of financial position, IAS 19 deficit and income statement are unchanged by the establishment of the SLP . The investment held by the plans in the SLP does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the group’s financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets. The value of the trade receivables transferred to the SLP remains on the group’s statement of financial position',\n",
       " 'As a result of the transactions under the ABF , the partnership’s statement of financial position, at the inception of the agreement, was changed to reflect its receivable from the SLP of £30 million, prepayment of contributions to the pension funds of £60 million and a liability of £90 million arising under the receivables purchase agreement. The IAS 19 deficit and income statement were unchanged',\n",
       " 'Because taxation in the partnership is a personal liability of the individual members, no deferred tax on the plans’ balances falls to be recorded in the financial statements of both the group and partnership',\n",
       " 'The High Court ruled on 26 October 2018 in the landmark Lloyds Banking Group case on the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP). The judgement requires equalisation between men and women for the effect of unequal GMPs and the impact of this decision was accounted for at 30 September 2019',\n",
       " 'This does not affect the pre-2000 fund but does affect the TMcL plan, as this arrangement was contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The group included an allowance of 1 .2% of the TMcL plan’s defined benefit obligation for the impact of the GMP equalisation at 30 September 2019 and the estimated increase in liabilities was recognised as a past service cost within the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2019. The same approach has been taken to derive the TMcL plan defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2020. On 20 November 2020, the High Court handed down a further judgement confirming that defined benefit schemes which provide GMPs need to revisit and, where necessary, top up historical cash equivalent transfer values that were calculated based on unequalised benefits. We consider that this latest judgement creates an additional obligation for the TMcL plan from the date of the judgement',\n",

The scope of the report includes KPMG’s operations in the UK excluding the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. We use electronic data collection processes to gather our data. Where data does not exist for a full 12 month reporting period we have estimated outstanding data by extrapolating known data. Our method for calculating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is based on the GHG Protocol standards and guidance documents',\n",

       " 'Energy consumption and associated carbon emissions in this period has been materially affected by the impact of COVID-19, however we have continued to work proactively to reduce our energy consumption and our carbon emissions where possible. In November 2019, we achieved certification to ISO50001, the standard for Energy Management Systems (EnMS). The development of the system has enabled us to monitor and report energy consumption more effectively and identify areas for continual improvement. Our electricity consumption has reduced 20% against 2019 due to the reduced use of our office estate during the pandemic. However, our natural gas has remained broadly the same as the lockdown occurred during the warmer months',\n",
       " 'This year we also deployed remote collaboration technology across the firm. In the first half of the year this reduced the amount of business travel being conducted and in the second half of the year, in response to the pandemic, became the default method of business communication and interaction. We continue to purchase renewable energy for our managed estate, and this year collaborated with our landlords in our leased buildings on renewable energy purchasing. We’re pleased to report 85% of the electricity we consume is purchased with Guarantees of Origin from renewable sources.
